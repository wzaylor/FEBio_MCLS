	abstract = {Knee ligaments are elastic bands of soft tissue with a complex microstructure and biomechanics, which are critical to determine the kinematics as well as the stress bearing behavior of the knee joint. Their correct implementation in terms of material models and properties is therefore necessary in the development of finite element models of the knee, which has been performed for decades for the investigation of both its basic biomechanics and the development of replacement implants and repair strategies for degenerative and traumatic pathologies. Indeed, a wide range of element types and material models has been used to represent knee ligaments, ranging from elastic unidimensional elements to complex hyperelastic three-dimensional structures with anatomically realistic shapes. This paper systematically reviews literature studies, which described finite element models of the knee, and summarizes the approaches, which have been used to model the ligaments highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.},

The method is a procedure for gaining surgical access to the posterior fibers of the {PLB} through a portal incised in the joint capsule and then suturing a liquid metal strain gage ({LMSG}) on to these fibres. Because the incision possibly alters the load-displacement mechanics of the joint, validation included performing experiments to test the hypothesis that the incision did not significantly affect load-displacement relations. To illustrate the utility of the method, strains in both the anteromedial bundle ({AMB}) and {PLB} were measured and compared over the full range of flexion. Validation experiments revealed that the capsular incision as well as other incisions had no measurable effect on the load-displacement mechanics of the joint. Also, the {PLB} strain was significantly different from the {AMB} strain during passive flexion with a reciprocating function in load sharing evident between the two bundles.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were (1) to develop subject-specific experimental and finite element ({FE}) techniques to study the three-dimensional stress–strain behavior of ligaments, with application to the human medial collateral ligament ({MCL}), and (2) to determine the importance of subject-specific material properties and initial (in situ) strain distribution for prediction of the strain distribution in the {MCL} under valgus loading. Eight male knees were subjected to varus–valgus loading at flexion angles of 0°, 30°, and 60°. Three-dimensional joint kinematics and {MCL} strains were recorded during kinematic testing. Following testing, the {MCL} of each knee was removed to allow measurement of the in situ strain distribution and to perform material testing. A {FE} model of the femur–{MCL}–tibia complex was constructed for each knee to simulate valgus loading at each flexion angle, using subject-specific bone and ligament geometry, material properties, and joint kinematics. A transversely isotropic hyperelastic material model was used to represent the {MCL}. The {MCL} in situ strain distribution at full extension was used to apply in situ strain to each {MCL} {FE} model. {FE} predicted {MCL} strains during valgus loading were compared to experimental measurements using regression analysis. The subject-specific {FE} predictions of strain correlated reasonably well with experimentally measured {MCL} strains (R2=0.83, 0.72, and 0.66 at 0°, 30°, and 60°, respectively). Despite large inter-subject variation in {MCL} material properties, {MCL} strain distributions predicted by individual {FE} models that used average {MCL} material properties were strongly correlated with subject-specific {FE} strain predictions (R2=0.99 at all flexion angles). However, predictions by {FE} models that used average in situ strain distributions yielded relatively poor correlations with subject-specific {FE} predictions (R2=0.44, 0.35, and 0.33 at flexion angles of 0°, 30°, and 60°, respectively). The strain distribution within the {MCL} was nonuniform and changed with flexion angle. The highest {MCL} strains occurred at full extension in the posterior region of the {MCL} proximal to the joint line during valgus loading, suggesting this region may be most vulnerable to injury under these loading conditions. This work demonstrates that subject-specific {FE} models can predict the complex, nonuniform strain fields that occur in ligaments due to external loading of the joint.},

	abstract = {The study objective was to investigate the influence of coronal plane alignment and ligament properties on total knee replacement ({TKR}) contact loads during walking. We created a subject-specific knee model of an 83-year-old male who had an instrumented {TKR}. The knee model was incorporated into a lower extremity musculoskeletal model and included deformable contact, ligamentous structures, and six degrees-of-freedom ({DOF}) tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints. A novel numerical optimization technique was used to simultaneously predict muscle forces, secondary knee kinematics, ligament forces, and joint contact pressures from standard gait analysis data collected on the subject. The nominal knee model predictions of medial, lateral, and total contact forces during gait agreed well with {TKR} measures, with root-mean-square (rms) errors of 0.23, 0.22, and 0.33 body weight ({BW}), respectively. Coronal plane component alignment did not affect total knee contact loads, but did alter the medial–lateral load distribution, with 4 deg varus and 4 deg valgus rotations in component alignment inducing +17\% and −23\% changes in the first peak medial tibiofemoral contact forces, respectively. A Monte Carlo analysis showed that uncertainties in ligament stiffness and reference strains induce ±0.2 {BW} uncertainty in tibiofemoral force estimates over the gait cycle. Ligament properties had substantial influence on the {TKR} load distributions, with the medial collateral ligament and iliotibial band ({ITB}) properties having the largest effects on medial and lateral compartment loading, respectively. The computational framework provides a viable approach for virtually designing {TKR} components, considering parametric uncertainty and predicting the effects of joint alignment and soft tissue balancing procedures on {TKR} function during movement.},

	abstract = {Twelve fresh frozen anatomic specimen knees were used in this study to measure changes in the tibiofemoral joint gaps after sacrificing the posterior cruciate ligament. Joint gap changes were measured using a motion tracking device in full extension and at 45° and 90° flexion. Tibiofemoral gaps were measured with no external compressive loads and under tension to define the flexion gap, the space available to be filled by components. After initial anterior cruciate ligament removal, meniscectomy, and a 1-cm tibial plateau cut, sacrifice of the posterior cruciate ligament caused significant differences in the flexion gap. At 90° flexion the tibia distracted from the femur 5.26 ± 1.9 mm (range, 3.2-9.1 mm) at rest and 6.4 ± 2.5 mm under tension. No differences in the joint space were calculated in full extension under either loading case. The authors conclude that a major result of posterior cruciate ligament sacrifice is the creation of a larger flexion gap. This result provides insight into relative joint line changes that can occur after posterior cruciate ligament sacrifice. It also suggests the need for greater attention to flexion stability when sacrificing the posterior cruciate ligament and rethinking the role of posterior cruciate ligament release in the management of pure, primary flexion contracture.},

	abstract = {Surgical technique is one factor that has been identified as critical to success of total knee arthroplasty. Researchers have shown that computer simulations can aid in determining how decisions in the operating room generally affect post-operative outcomes. However, to use simulations to make clinically relevant predictions about knee forces and motions for a specific total knee patient, patient-specific models are needed. This study introduces a methodology for estimating knee soft-tissue properties of an individual total knee patient. A custom surgical navigation system and stability device were used to measure the force–displacement relationship of the knee. Soft-tissue properties were estimated using a parameter optimization that matched simulated tibiofemoral kinematics with experimental tibiofemoral kinematics. Simulations using optimized ligament properties had an average root mean square error of 3.5° across all tests while simulations using generic ligament properties taken from literature had an average root mean square error of 8.4°. Specimens showed large variability among ligament properties regardless of similarities in prosthetic component alignment and measured knee laxity. These results demonstrate the importance of soft-tissue properties in determining knee stability, and suggest that to make clinically relevant predictions of post-operative knee motions and forces using computer simulations, patient-specific soft-tissue properties are needed. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

One method is based on an inverse design analysis to calculate a stress-free reference configuration. The other method developed here is based on a modified updated Lagrangian formulation.

	abstract = {Strain within the medial collateral ligament ({MCL}) was measured in 13 human knee specimens to determine both the single and combined external loads most likely to cause injury. Using a load application system which allowed six degrees of freedom with flexion angle being fixed, both single loads of anterior/posterior force, medial/lateral force, varus/valgus torque, and internal/external axial torque and all pairs of these loads were applied at flexion angles of 0° and 30°. Liquid mercury strain gages were used to measure strain at four sites in the {MCL}. Two of the sites were the anterior fibers superior and inferior to the joint line and the other two were posterior of the two anterior sites. A factorial analysis revealed a significant interaction between the site experiencing the greatest strain and flexion angle. The posterior superior site experienced significantly greater strain at 0° flexion whereas strain was significantly greater at the anterior superior site at 30° flexion. Of the single moments, external axial was more damaging than valgus in that the strain developed at equivalent load was significantly greater. None of the moment-moment combinations was identified as being significantly more damaging. A similar result held for the force-moment combinations.},

The interaction between the {AM} and {PL} bundles, as well as the contact and friction caused by the {ACL} wrapping around the bone during knee motion, were included in the model. The {AM} and {PL} bundles of the {ACL} were simulated as incompressible homogeneous and isotropic hyperelastic materials. The multiple-degrees-of-freedom ({DOF}) knee kinematics of a cadaveric knee were first obtained using a robotic/universal force–moment sensor testing system. These data were used as the boundary conditions for the {FEM} of the {ACL} to calculate the forces in the {ACL}. The calculated forces were compared to the in situ force in the {ACL}, determined experimentally, to validate the model. The validated {FEM} was then used to calculate the force and stress distribution within the {ACL} under an anterior tibial load at full extension. The {AM} and {PL} bundles shared the force, and the stress distribution was non-uniform within both bundles with the highest stress localized near the femoral insertion site. The contact and friction caused by the {ACL} wrapping around the bone during knee motion played the role of transferring the force from the {ACL} to the bone, and had a direct effect on the force and stress distribution of the {ACL}. This validated model will enable the analysis of force and stress distribution in the {ACL} in response to more complex loading conditions and has the potential to help design improved surgical procedures following {ACL} injuries.},

	abstract = {The medial collateral ligament is one of the most frequently injured ligaments in the knee. Although the medial collateral ligament is known to provide a primary restraint to valgus and external rotations, details regarding its precise mechanical function are unknown. In this study, strain in the medial collateral ligament of eight knees from male cadavers was measured during valgus loading. A material testing machine was used to apply 10 cycles of varus and valgus rotation to limits of +/- 10.0 N-m at flexion angles of 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees. A three-dimensional motion analysis system measured local tissue strain on the medial collateral ligament surface within 12 regions encompassing nearly the entire medial collateral ligament surface. Results indicated that strain is significantly different in different regions over the surface of the medial collateral ligament and that this distribution of strain changes with flexion angle and with the application of a valgus torque. Strain in the posterior and central portions of the medial collateral ligament generally decreased with increasing flexion angle, whereas strain in the anterior fibers remained relatively constant with changes in flexion angle. The highest strains in the medial collateral ligament were found at full extension on the posterior side of the medial collateral ligament near the femoral insertion. These data support clinical findings that suggest the femoral insertion is the most common location for medial collateral ligament injuries.},

Our objective was to measure the kinematics of the medial collateral ligament during the stance phase of gait on a treadmill using a combined dual fluoroscopic imaging system ({DFIS}) and {MRI} technique.{MethodsThree}-dimensional models of the knee were constructed using magnetic resonance images of 7 healthy human knees. The contours of insertion areas of the superficial {MCL} ({sMCL}) and deep {MCL} ({dMCL}) on the femur and tibia were constructed using the coronal plane {MR} images of each knee. Both the {sMCL} and the {dMCL} were separated into 3 portions: the anterior, mid, and posterior bundles. The relative elongation of the bundles was calculated using the bundle length at heel strike (or 0\% of the stance phase) as a reference.{ResultsThe} lengths of the anterior bundles were positively correlated with the knee flexion angle. The mid-bundles of the {sMCL} and {dMCL} were found to function similarly in trend with the anterior bundles during the stance phase of the gait and their lengths had weak correlations with the knee flexion angles. The elongations of the posterior bundles of {sMCL} and {dMCL} were peaked at mid-stance and terminal extension/pre-swing stance phase. The lengths of the posterior bundles were negatively correlated with the knee flexion during the stance phase.{ConclusionThe} data of this study demonstrated that the anterior and posterior bundles of the {sMCL} and {dMCL} have a reciprocal function during the stance phase of gait. This data provide insight into the function of the {MCL} and a normal reference for the study of physiology and pathology of the {MCL}.

	abstract = {Anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) rupture leads to abnormal loading of the knee joint and increases the risk of osteoarthritis. It is unclear how different {ACL} reconstruction techniques affect knee joint motion and mechanics. As the in vivo measurement of knee joint loading is not possible, we used finite element analysis to assess the outcome of {ACL} reconstruction techniques. Effects of different {ACL} reconstruction techniques on knee joint mechanics were studied using six models during gait; with 1) healthy {ACL}, 2) {ACL} rupture, 3) single bundle {ACL} reconstruction, 4) double bundle {ACL} reconstruction, 5) weakened (softer) single bundle reconstruction and 6) single bundle reconstruction with less pre-strain. Early in the gait, the {ACL} rupture caused substantially increased tibial translation in the anterior direction as well as a smaller but increased lateral translation and internal tibial rotation. {ACL} rupture substantially reduced average stresses and strains, while local peak stresses and strains could be either increased or decreased. Single bundle and double bundle reconstructions restored joint motion close to normal levels. However, cartilage strains and stresses were elevated during the entire gait cycle. Models with modulated graft stiffness and pre-strain restored the joint motion and cartilage stresses and strains close to the normal, healthy levels. Results suggest that rather than the choice of reconstruction technique, stiffness and pre-strain of the {ACL} reconstruction affect the motion and mechanics of the operated knee. We suggest that an optimal choice of graft properties might help restore normal knee joint function and cartilage responses, thus, minimizing the risk of osteoarthritis.},

Subject-specific geometries and kinematic data, acquired from the same living subject, were the foundations of the 3D quasi-static knee model developed. Each cruciate ligament was modelled by means of 25 elastic springs, paying attention to the anatomical twisting of the fibres. The sensitivity of the model to the cross-sectional area was performed during the anterior/posterior tibial translations, the sensitivity to all the cruciate ligaments parameters was performed during the internal/external rotations. The model reproduced very well the mechanical behaviour reported in literature during anterior/posterior translations, in particular considering 30\% of the mean insertional area. During the internal/external tibial rotations, similar behaviour of the axial torques was obtained in the three sensitivity analyses. The overlapping of the ligaments was assessed at about 25° of internal axial rotation. The presented model featured a good level of accuracy in combination with a low computational weight, and it could provide an in vivo estimation of the role of the cruciate ligaments during the execution of daily living activities.},

Sensor-integrated tibial trials have been introduced that allow real-time measurement of tibiofemoral kinematics during {TKA}. This study examined the interplay between tibiofemoral force and laxity, under defined intraoperative conditions, so as to quantify the kinematic behaviour of the {CR} femoral single-radius knee.{MethodsTKA} was undertaken in eight loaded cadaveric specimens. Computer navigation in combination with sensor data defined laxity and tibiofemoral contact force, respectively, during manual laxity testing. Fixed-effect linear modelling allowed quantification of the effect for flexion angle, direction of movement and {TKA} implantation upon the knee.{ResultsAn} inverse relationship between laxity and contact force was demonstrated. With flexion, laxity increased as contact force decreased under manual stress. Change in laxity was significant beyond 30° for coronal plane laxity and beyond 60° for rotatory laxity (p {\textless} 0.01). Rotational stress in mid-flexion demonstrated the greatest mismatch in inter-compartmental forces. Contact point position over the tibial sensor demonstrated paradoxical roll-forward with knee flexion.{ConclusionTraditional} balancing techniques may not reliably equate to uniform laxity or contact forces across the tibiofemoral joint through a range of flexion and argue for the role of per-operative sensor use to aid final balancing of the knee.},

It was hypothesized that the ultimate failure strength, stiffness, and attachment area of each native root would be significantly higher than those of the respective sectioned root.Study Design:Controlled laboratory study.Methods:Twelve matched pairs of male human cadaveric knees were used. The 4 native meniscal roots were left intact in the native group, whereas the roots in the contralateral knee (sectioned group) were dissected free of all supplemental fibers. A coordinate measuring device quantified the amount of tissue resected in the sectioned group compared with the native group. A dynamic tensile testing machine pulled each root in line with its circumferential fibers. All root attachments were preconditioned from 10 to 50 N at a rate of 0.1 Hz for 10 cycles and subsequently pulled to failure at a rate of 0.5 mm/s.Results:Supplemental fibers composed a significant percentage of the native {PM}, {PL}, and {AM} meniscal root attachment areas. Mean ultimate failure strengths (in newtons) of the native {PM}, {PL}, and {AM} roots were significantly higher than those of the sectioned state, while the ultimate failure strength of the native {AL} root was indistinguishable from that of the sectioned state.Conclusion:Three of the 4 meniscal root attachments ({PM}, {PL}, {AM}) contained supplemental fibers that accounted for a significant percentage of the native root attachment areas, and these fibers significantly contributed to the failure strengths of the native roots.Clinical Relevance:These supplemental fibers are not routinely reattached during root repair surgery, suggesting that current techniques fail to reattach the biomechanically relevant attachments of native meniscal roots.},

	abstract = {Background:The clinical importance of the meniscal posterior root attachments has been recently reported by both biomechanical and clinical studies. Although several studies have been performed to evaluate surgical techniques, there have been few studies on the quantitative arthroscopically pertinent anatomy of the posterior meniscal root attachments.Hypothesis:The posterior root attachments of the medial and lateral menisci are consistent among specimens, and repeatable quantitative measurements using arthroscopically pertinent landmarks are achievable.Study Design:Descriptive laboratory study.Methods:Twelve nonpaired, fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were used. The positions of the posterior root attachments of the medial and lateral menisci were identified, and 3-dimensional measurements to arthroscopically pertinent landmarks were performed using a coordinate measuring system.Results:The direct distance (±standard error of the mean) between the medial tibial eminence apex and the medial meniscus posterior root attachment center was 11.5 (±0.9) mm. When split into directional components along the knee?s main axes, the medial meniscus posterior root attachment center was 9.6 (±0.8) mm posterior and 0.7 (±0.4) mm lateral along the bony surface from the medial tibial eminence apex. It was located 3.5 (±0.4) mm lateral from the medial articular cartilage inflection point and directly 8.2 (±0.7) mm from the nearest tibial attachment margin of the posterior cruciate ligament. The direct distance between the lateral tibial eminence apex and the lateral meniscus posterior root attachment center was 5.3 (±0.3) mm. When it was split into directional components using the knee?s main axes, the lateral meniscus posterior root attachment center was 4.2 (±0.4) mm medial and 1.5 (±0.7) mm posterior from the lateral tibial eminence apex. The lateral meniscus posterior root attachment center was located 4.3 (±0.5) mm medial from the nearest articular cartilage margin and directly 12.7 (±1.1) mm from the nearest margin of the tibial attachment of the posterior cruciate ligament.Conclusion:This quantitative study reproducibly identified the posterior root attachment centers of the medial and lateral menisci in relation to arthroscopically pertinent landmarks and guidelines.Clinical Relevance:These data can be directly applied to assist in anatomic meniscal root repairs.},

We show that the modification of material functions is caused by the need of updating material symmetry in the inverse solution process. Several theoretical results were obtained while establishing the equivalence, including an identity relating the inverse and forward tangent tensors for isotropic materials.

The problem consists in determining the initial shape of the piece, such that it attains the designed shape under the effect of service loads. The model is particularly focused on the design of parts with a markedly anisotropic behavior, like laminated turbine blades. Although the formulation expresses equilibrium on the distorted configuration, it uses a standard constitutive equations library that is expressed as usual for measures attached to the undistorted configuration. In this way, the modifications to a standard finite elements code are limited to the routines for the computation of the finite element internal forces and tangent matrix. Two examples are given, the first one for validation purposes, while the second is an application which has industrial interest for the design of turbine blades.

In this letter, following recent developments in inverse deformation problems, the governing equations for static hyperelasticity problems are formulated in the current configuration after deformation. An inverse mapping from the deformed geometry to the original one is solved as the unknown field. Such an approach, herein referred to as the inverse Lagrangian formulation, is exemplified with several applications in addition to the inverse problem of known deformed geometry by design and determination of the original geometry. Applications are found in steady-state fluid–structure interaction problems, such as the design of microfluidic devices. More importantly, the method is also found to be useful in analyzing mechanical instability and bifurcation problems, as the inverse mapping from a buckled state to the original remains unique.},

One of the many challenges of this approach, however, is identification of a stress-free reference configuration based on in vivo images of loaded and often prestrained or residually stressed soft tissues and organs. Fortunately, iterative methods have been proposed to solve this inverse problem, among them Sellier’s method. This method is particularly appealing because it is easy to implement, convergences reasonably fast, and can be coupled to nearly any finite element package. By means of several practical examples, however, we demonstrate that in its original formulation Sellier’s method is not optimally fast and may not converge for problems with large deformations. Fortunately, we can also show that a simple, inexpensive augmentation of Sellier’s method based on Aitken’s delta-squared process can not only ensure convergence but also significantly accelerate the method.},

The iterative algorithm stems from the rather intuitive observation that a better estimate of the required initial shape can be obtained by adding a correction to the previous shape estimate equal to the computed mismatch in the deformed shapes. A detailed convergence analysis explains the reason behind the success of the proposed algorithm. Compared to other techniques described in the literature to solve such inverse problems, this iterative scheme offers the advantage of being easy to implement and readily compatible with the use of commercial solver packages. Two benchmark problems are treated to illustrate the success of the algorithm: that of a punctured membrane and that of a cantilever beam in cross flow. The latter illustrates that the concepts described here readily applies to steady fluid–structure interaction problems leading to an interesting range of new applications.},

Musculoskeletal soft tissues, such as articular cartilage, ligaments, knee meniscus and intervertebral disk, have a complex structure, which provides elasticity and capability to support and distribute the body loads. Soft tissues describe an inhomogeneous and multiphasic structure, and exhibit a nonlinear, time-dependent behavior. Their mechanical response is governed by a substance composed of protein fiber-rich and proteoglycan-rich extracellular matrix and interstitial fluid. Protein fibers (e.g. collagen) give the tissue direction dependent stiffness and strength. To investigate these complex biological systems, the use of mathematical tools is well established, alone or in combination with experimental in vitro and in vivo tests. However, the development of these models poses many challenges due to the complex structure and mechanical response of soft tissues.
Methods
Non-systematic literature review.
Findings
This paper provides a summary of different modeling strategies with associated material properties, contact interactions between articulating tissues, validation and sensitivity of soft tissues with special focus on knee joint soft tissues and intervertebral disk. Furthermore, it reviews and discusses some salient clinical findings of reported finite element simulations.
Interpretation
Model studies extensively contributed to the understanding of functional biomechanics of soft tissues. Models can be effectively used to elucidate clinically relevant questions. However, users should be aware of the complexity of such tissues and of the capabilities and limitations of these approaches to adequately simulate a specific in vivo or in vitro phenomenon.},

	abstract = {It is often important to include prestress in computational models of biological tissues. The prestress can represent residual stresses (stresses that exist after the tissue is excised from the body) or in situ stresses (stresses that exist in vivo, in the absence of loading). A prestressed reference configuration may also be needed when modeling the reference geometry of biological tissues in vivo. This research developed a general framework for representing prestress in finite element models of biological materials. It is assumed that the material is elastic, allowing the prestress to be represented via a prestrain. For prestrain fields that are not compatible with the reference geometry, the computational framework provides an iterative algorithm for updating the prestrain until equilibrium is satisfied. The iterative framework allows for enforcement of two different constraints: elimination of distortion in order to address the incompatibility issue, and enforcing a specified in situ fiber strain field while allowing for distortion. The framework was implemented as a plugin in {FEBio} (www.febio.org), making it easy to maintain the software and to extend the framework if needed. Several examples illustrate the application and effectiveness of the approach, including the application of in situ strains to ligaments in the Open Knee model (simtk.org/home/openknee). A novel method for recovering the stress-free configuration from the prestrain deformation gradient is also presented. This general purpose theoretical and computational framework for applying prestrain will allow analysts to overcome the challenges in modeling this important aspect of biological tissue mechanics.},

	abstract = {Residual stress is the stress present in the unloaded equilibrium configuration of a body. Because residual stresses can significantly affect the mechanical behavior of a component, the measurement of these stresses and the prediction of their effect on mechanical behavior are important objectives in many engineering problems. Common methods for the measurement of residual stresses include various destructive experiments in which the body is cut to relieve the residual stress. The resulting strain is measured and used to approximate the original residual stress in the intact body. In order to predict the mechanical behavior of a residually stressed body, a constitutive model is required that includes the influence of the residual stress.In this paper we present a method by which the data obtained from standard destructive experiments can be used to derive constitutive equations that describe the mechanical behavior of elastic residually stressed bodies. The derivation is based on the idea that for each infinitesimal neighborhood in a residually stressed body, there exists a corresponding stress free configuration. We refer to this stress free configuration as the ‘virtual’ configuration of the infinitesimal neighborhood. The derivation requires that the constitutive equation for the stress free material be known and invertible; it is used to relate the residual stress to the deformation of the virtual configuration into the residually stressed configuration. Although the concept of the virtual configuration is central to the derivation, the geometry of this configuration need not be determined explicitly, and it need not be achievable experimentally, in order to construct the constitutive equation for the residually stressed body.The general mathematical forms of constitutive equations valid for residually stressed elastic materials have been derived previously for a number of cases. These general forms contain numerous unknown material-response functions or material constants that must be determined experimentally. In contrast, the method presented here results in a constitutive equation that is an explicit function of residual stress and includes only the material parameters required to describe the stress free material.After presenting the method for the derivation of constitutive equations, we explore the relationship between destructive experiments and the theory used in the derivation. Specifically, we discuss the use of the theory to improve the design of destructive experiments, and the use of destructive experiments to obtain the data required to construct the constitutive equation for a particular material.},

While the anatomy of the primary posterolateral corner structures has been qualitatively and quantitatively described, a quantitative analysis regarding the insertions of the biceps femoris on the fibula and proximal tibia is lacking.Purpose:To quantitatively assess the insertions of the biceps femoris, fibular collateral ligament ({FCL}), and anterolateral ligament ({ALL}) on the fibula and proximal tibia as well as establish relationships among these structures and to pertinent surgical anatomy.Study Design:Descriptive laboratory study.Methods:Dissections were performed on 12 nonpaired, fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens identifying the biceps femoris, {FCL}, and {ALL}, and their insertions on the proximal tibia and fibula. The footprint areas, orientations, and distances from relevant osseous landmarks were measured using a 3-dimensional coordinate measurement device.Results:Dissection produced 6 easily identifiable and reproducible anatomic footprints. Tibial footprints included the insertion of the {ALL} and an insertion of the biceps femoris ({TBF}). Fibular footprints included the insertion of the {FCL}, a distal insertion of the biceps femoris ({DBF}), a medial footprint of the biceps femoris ({MBF}), and a proximal footprint of the biceps femoris ({PBF}). The mean area of these footprints (95\% {CI}) was as follows: {ALL}, 53.0 mm2 (38.4-67.6); {TBF}, 93.9 mm2 (72.0-115.8); {FCL}, 86.8 mm2 (72.3-101.2); {DBF}, 119 mm2 (91.1-146.9); {MBF}, 46.8 mm2 (29.0-64.5); and {PBF}, 215 mm2 (192.4-237.5). The mean distance (95\% {CI}) from the Gerdy tubercle to the center of the {ALL} footprint was 24.3 mm (21.6-27.0) and to the center of the {TBF} was 22.5 mm (21.0-24.0). The center of the {DBF} was 8.68 mm (7.0-10.3) from the anterior border of the fibula, the center of the {FCL} was 14.6 mm (12.5-16.7) from the anterior border of the fibula and 20.7 mm (19.0-22.4) from the tip of the fibular styloid, and the center of the {PBF} was 8.96 mm (8.2-9.7) from the tip of the fibular styloid.Conclusion:A tibial footprint, distal fibular footprint, medial fibular footprint, and proximal fibular footprint were all consistent components of the insertion of the biceps femoris. Consistent relationships existed between the biceps femoris and insertions of the {ALL} and {FCL}.Clinical Relevance:The size of these footprints and distances from pertinent surgical landmarks will guide repairs of biceps femoris avulsion injuries.},

	abstract = {Background:While the biomechanical importance of the meniscal roots has been demonstrated, the anatomy of the anterior meniscal roots remains largely unknown. Defining the quantitative anatomy of the anterior meniscal root attachments is essential for developing improved diagnostic and surgical techniques.Hypothesis:The anterior medial ({AM}) and anterior lateral ({AL}) meniscal roots could be quantitatively defined relative to open and arthroscopic surgical landmarks.Study Design:Descriptive laboratory study.Methods:Twelve nonpaired human cadaveric knees were used (average age, 51.3 years). A coordinate measuring device quantified the anatomic relationships of the {AM} and {AL} root attachments to open and arthroscopic surgical landmarks. The tibial attachments of both anterior roots were defined and quantified by categorizing the fibers of the root as either central, dense attachments or peripheral, supplemental attachments.Results:The center of the tibial tuberosity and the medial tibial eminence apex were 27.0 mm lateral and distal and 27.5 mm posterior to the center of the {AM} root, respectively. The center of the anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) and the lateral tibial eminence apex were 5.0 mm posteromedial and 14.4 mm posterolateral to the center of the {AL} root, respectively. The {AM} root attachment had a mean area of 110.4 mm2 (95\% {CI}, 92.2-128.5) with a central attachment of 56.3 mm2 (95\% {CI}, 46.9-65.8). The {AL} root attachment had a mean area of 140.7 mm2 (95\% {CI}, 121.6-159.8) and inserted deeply beneath the {ACL} in all specimens. The overlap of the {ACL} on the {AL} root averaged 88.9 mm2 (95\% {CI}, 63.3-114.6), comprising 63.2\% of the {AL} root attachment.Conclusion:The anterior meniscal roots were identified in relation to pertinent open and arthroscopic landmarks. The extended overlap between the {AL} root and {ACL} attachment revealed a more intimate tibial attachment relationship than previously recognized.Clinical Relevance:Quantitative descriptions of the anterior meniscal roots elucidate the relationship between the root attachments and pertinent surgical landmarks. In addition, the supplemental attachments of both menisci may contribute to native meniscal function, and further investigation is recommended.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study was to review the anatomy of the quadriceps tendon and provide guidelines for harvesting the quadriceps tendon for anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) reconstruction.
Methods
Eleven cadaveric knees were dissected, and the quadriceps tendon was analyzed. Multiple measurements of length, depth, and width were taken in a standardized manner for each cadaver and recorded.
Results
The quadriceps tendon superficial morphology showed 2 distinct peaks, with the maximum length correlating with the lateral peak. The mean tendon peak length was 88.3 ± 8.4 mm (range, 78.3 to 99.7 mm). The mean width of the quadriceps tendon at its insertion onto the patella was 43.3 ± 5.8 mm (range, 34.3 to 54.1 mm). The quadriceps tendon was noted to be asymmetric, with the maximum tendon length located at 61.6\% ± 4.1\% of the width from the medial border of the quadriceps tendon insertion. This point was also the maximum tendon depth at insertion.
Conclusions
Quadriceps free tendon graft harvesting should begin by locating the apex (maximum length) of the quadriceps tendon (61\% of the distance from the patella's medial edge). The surgeon should then harvest a 10-mm-wide graft centered about 2 mm medial to this point, using the depth of a No. 10 scalpel blade (7 mm) as a guide to thickness to harvest an optimal quadriceps free tendon graft for {ACL} reconstruction.
Clinical Relevance
This anatomic study identifies the site of harvest of a quadriceps free tendon autograft (without a patellar bone block) to maximize the length and bulk of the graft for its use in {ACL} reconstruction.},

	abstract = {Most descriptions of the extensor mechanism of the knee do not take into account its complexity and variability. The quadriceps femoris insertion into the patella is said to be through a common tendon with a three-layered arrangement: rectus femoris ({RF}) most superficially, vastus medialis ({VM}) and lateralis ({VL}) in the intermediate layer, and vastus intermedius ({VI}) most deeply. We dissected 20 limbs from 17 cadavers to provide a more detailed description of the anterior components of the knee: the tendon, the patellar retinacula, and the patellofemoral ligaments. Only three of the 20 specimens exhibited the typically described quadriceps pattern. The remainder had bilaminar and even more complex trilaminar and tetralaminar fiber arrangements. We found an oblique head of the vastus lateralis ({VLO}), separated from the longitudinal head by a layer of fat or fascia, in 60\% of the specimens. However, we found no distinct oblique head of the vastus medialis ({VMO}) in any specimen. The medial patellofemoral ligament ({MPFL}) was more common than the lateral ({LPFL}), supporting its suggested role as the principal passive medial stabilizer of the patella. Because the quadriceps muscle group plays a direct role in patellofemoral joint function, investigation into the clinical applications of its highly variable anatomy may be worthwhile with respect to joint dysfunction and failures of {TKAs}.},

Purpose: To define the anatomy and isometry of the medial patellofemoral ligament. Study Type: Cadaveric study.
Methods: The authors dissected the medial patellofemoral ligament in 11 cadaveric knees and recorded its anatomic relationships. They evaluated the isometry of the medial patellofemoral ligament by obtaining measurements between various anatomic pairings at certain fixed angles of knee flexion.
Results: During knee flexion from 0° to 90°, the portion of the medial patellofemoral ligament from the inferior patellar attachment to the superior femoral attachment was nearly isometric, demonstrating an average change in length of only 1.1 mm. Statistical analysis showed the superior femoral attachment to be most significant in determining isometric behavior.
Conclusions: The most isometric portion of the medial patellofemoral ligament is the inferior portion of its patellar attachment extending to the superior portion of its femoral attachment, with the superior femoral attachment having the most notable influences on isometry.},

	doi = {10.1002/jor.20396},
	abstract = {Small variability associated with identifying and locating anatomical landmarks on the knee has the potential to affect the joint coordinate systems and reported kinematic descriptions. The objectives of this study were to develop an approach to quantify the effect of landmark location variability on both tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics and to identify the critical landmarks and associated degrees of freedom that most affected the kinematic measures. The commonly used three-cylindric open-chain kinematic description utilized measured rigid body kinematics from a cadaveric specimen during simulated gait. A probabilistic analysis was performed with 11 anatomical landmarks to predict the variability in each kinematic. The model predicted the absolute kinematic bounds and offset kinematic bounds, emphasizing profile shape, for each kinematic over the gait cycle, as well as the range of motion. Standard deviations of up to 2 mm were assumed for the anatomical landmark locations and resulted in significant variability in clinically relevant absolute kinematic parameters of up to 6.5 degrees and 4.4 mm for tibiofemoral and 7.6 degrees and 6.5 mm for patellofemoral kinematics. The location of the femoral epicondylar prominences had the greatest effect on both the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematic descriptions. A quantitative understanding of the potential changes in kinematic description caused by anatomical landmark variability is important not only to the accuracy of kinematic gait studies and the evaluation of total knee arthroplasty implant performance, but also may impact component placement decision-making in computer-assisted surgery.

Our aim was to clarify the differing descriptions with a simplified interpretation of the anatomy and its contribution to the stability of the knee.We dissected 20 fresh-frozen cadaver knees and the anatomy was recorded using video and still digital photography. The anatomy was described by dividing the medial collateral ligament ({MCL}) complex into thirds, from anterior to posterior and into superficial and deep layers. The main passive restraining structures of the posteromedial aspect of the knee were found to be superficial {MCL} (parallel, longitudinal fibres), the deep {MCL} and the posteromedial capsule ({PMC}). In the posterior third, the superficial and deep layers blend. Although there are oblique fibres (capsular condensations) running posterodistally from femur to tibia, no discrete ligament was seen. In extension, the {PMC} appears to be an important functional unit in restraining tibial internal rotation and valgus.Our aim was to clarify and possibly simplify the anatomy of the posteromedial structures. The information would serve as the basis for future biomechanical studies to investigate the contribution of the posteromedial structures to joint stability.},

	abstract = {Little is known about knee-specific factors that influence contact mechanics. Finite Element ({FE}) models offer a powerful tool to study contact mechanics, but there often exists ambiguity in the exact values of the inputs (e.g., tissue properties), which can result in a range of output values. Our objective was to quantify the reduction in the range of output values (defined herein as “uncertainty”) from {FE} models of the human knee joint when known pre-defined values are used for clinically measurable inputs. To achieve this goal, we applied a statistically augmented {FE} approach to three human cadaveric knees for which full geometric and kinematic data were available. Two sets of conditions were simulated: All model inputs, clinically measurable or not, were varied to represent a “normal” patient population (Condition 1); subsets of clinically measurable variable inputs were fixed at specific values (called “patient derived inputs,” or {PDIs}) while the other variables were varied over “normal” values (Condition 2). We found that by fixing body mass index and the anterior–posterior position of the meniscal-bony insertion points, model output uncertainty was reduced by one- to three-fifths. The magnitude of uncertainty reduction was strongly influenced by the individual knee. It was observed that knees with great anterior–posterior translation during gait had greater reductions in uncertainty when {PDIs} were used. This study represents the first step in developing {FE} models of the human knee joint based on inputs that can be derived from patients in a clinical setting. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

	abstract = {The anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) consists of two major fiber bundles, namely the anteromedial and posterolateral bundle. When the knee is extended, the posterolateral bundle ({PL}) is tight and the anteromedial ({AM}) bundle is moderately lax. As the knee is flexed, the femoral attachment of the {ACL} becomes a more horizontal orientation; causing the {AM} bundle to tighten and the {PL} bundle to relax. There is some degree of variability for the femoral origin of the anterome-dial and posterolateral bundle. The anteromedial bundle is located proximal and anterior in the femoral {ACL} origin (high and deep in the notch when the knee is flexed at 90°); the posterolateral bundle starts in the distal and posterior aspect of the femoral {ACL} origin (shallow and low when the knee is flexed at 90°). In the frontal plane the anteromedial bundle origin is in the 10:30 clock position and the postero-lateral bundle origin in the 9:30 clock position. At the tibial insertion the {ACL} fans out to form the foot region. The anteromedial bundle insertion is in the anterior part of the tibial {ACL} footprint, the posterolateral bundle in the posterior part. While the anteromedial bundle is the primary restraint against anterior tibial translation, the posterolateral bundle tends to stabilize the knee near full extension, particularly against rotatory loads.},

	abstract = {The study objective was to construct and validate a subject-specific knee model that can simulate full six degree of freedom tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joint behavior in the context of full body movement. Segmented {MR} images were used to reconstruct the geometry of 14 ligament bundles and articular cartilage surfaces. The knee was incorporated into a lower extremity musculoskeletal model, which was then used to simulate laxity tests, passive knee flexion, active knee flexion, and human walking. Simulated passive and active knee kinematics were shown to be consistent with subject-specific measures obtained via dynamic {MRI}. Anterior tibial translation and internal tibial rotation exhibited the greatest variability when uncertainties in ligament properties were considered. When used to simulate walking, the model predicted knee kinematic patterns that differed substantially from passive joint behavior. Predictions of mean knee cartilage contact pressures during normal gait reached 6.2 and 2.8 {MPa} on the medial tibial plateau and patellar facets, respectively. Thus, the dynamic modeling framework can be used to simulate the interaction of soft tissue loads and cartilage contact during locomotion activities, and therefore provides a basis to simulate the effects of soft tissue injury and surgical treatment on functional knee mechanics.},

	abstract = {Modern total knee arthroplasty ({TKA}) is an effective procedure to treat pain and disability due to osteoarthritis, but some patients experience quadriceps weakness after surgery and have difficulty performing important activities of daily living. The success of {TKA} depends on many factors, but malalignment of the prosthetic components is a major cause of postoperative complications. Significant variability is associated with femoral and tibial component rotational alignment, but how this variability translates into functional outcome remains unknown. We used a forward-dynamic computer model of a simulated squatting motion to perform a parametric study of the effects of variations in component rotational alignment in {TKA}. A cruciate-retaining and posterior-stabilized version of the same {TKA} implant were compared. We found that femoral rotation had a greater effect on quadriceps forces, collateral ligament forces, and varus/valgus kinematics, while tibial rotation had a greater effect on anteroposterior translations. Our findings support the tendency for orthopedic surgeons to bias the femoral component into external rotation and avoid malrotation of the tibial component. (C) 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The nature of the complaint after arthroplasty can help determine the etiology of failure. The primary causes of failure of total knee arthroplasty are pain, postoperative stiffness, and instability. Pain associated with weight bearing is most often mechanical and is caused by loosening, component failure, or patellar dysfunction. Continuous pain can be associated with infection or complex regional pain syndrome. Persistent postoperative stiffness may be caused by inadequate rehabilitation or improper balancing of ﬂexion and extension spaces. However, loss of motion after satisfactory mobility has been achieved may be associated with infection, synovitis, tendinitis, or component loosening. Instability after total knee arthroplasty results from improper balancing, inappropriate component size, and component failure. Posterior instability generally occurs during ﬂexion. Medial-lateral instability can result from either improper balancing of components or incompetent collateral ligaments. Radiographs can detect loosening and osteolysis, as well as component wear, fracture, and malposition. Nuclear scans can aid in detecting loosening and infection. If infection is suspected, aspiration is mandatory to attempt to conﬁrm the diagnosis and identify an organism.},

However, failure of {UKA} occurs due to either progressive osteoarthritis ({OA}) in the other compartment or wear on the polyethylene ({PE}) insert. This study used finite element ({FE}) analysis to investigate the effects of {PE} insert contact pressure and stress in opposite compartments for fixed? and mobile?bearing {UKA}. Analysis was performed using high kinematics displacement and rotation inputs, which were based on the kinematics of the natural knee. {ISO} standards were used for axial load and flexion. The mobile?bearing {PE} insert had lower contact pressure than the fixed?bearing {PE} insert. With the mobile?bearing {UKA}, lower stress on the opposite compartment reduces the overall risk of progressive {OA} in the knee. The fixed?bearing {UKA} increases the overall risk of progressive {OA} in the knee due to higher stress on the opposite compartment. However, the {PE} insert of mobile?bearing showed pronounced backside stress at the inferior surface. ? 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Furthermore, risks associated with over release, and the necessity of medial release, are discussed.{ResultsThe} different medial release sequences are discussed in relation to pre-operative deformity, along with potential complications associated with medial release. It was found that release sequences may include the deep and superficial components of the medial collateral ligament, the posteromedial capsule, the posterior oblique ligament, the pes anserinus (pes A), and tendons of the semimembranosus and medial gastrocnemius muscle. The sequences described were found to vary substantially between studies, and very few studies had systematically quantified the effect of each release on balance.{ConclusionWhile} medial release is the standard intraoperative mode of balancing, there is a lack of evidence to support current methods. The correct method for defining intraoperatively the sequence, extent and magnitude of releases required remains ill-defined. It could be argued that the classic extensive medial release may be unnecessary and may be associated with iatrogenic injury to the pes A and saphenous nerve, instability and abnormal knee kinematics. Minimal medial release may allow for improved soft tissue balancing leading ultimately to improved functional outcome.Level of {evidenceV} (expert opinion).},

	abstract = {Introduction:It has been realized that for osteoarthritis ({OA}) knee with varus deformity, posterior cruciate ligament ({PCL}) release resulted in the increase of the flexion gap without significant effect on the extension gap. While the effect of release on gap angle is still obscure. On the other hand, gap distance and varus angle measured under different distraction forces suggest different patterns.Objectives:In the current study, mechanical gap balance in displacement and angular alternation of extension and flexion gaps will be evaluated, with {PCL} fully retained or resected under different distracting forces in varus knees.Methods:Fifty cases with medial {OA} undergoing posterior-stabilized ({PS}) total knee arthroplasty ({TKA}) were included in the study. {PCL} of all the cases were identified intact before resection. After distal femoral and proximal tibial cuts were initially performed and anterior cruciate ligament was excised, joint gap angle and distance in full extension and at 90° flexion were obtained by means of a tensioning device with 10, 20 and 30 inch-pounds (in-lbf) of distraction force. The gap angle and distance were measured three times at each step. After the excision of {PCL}, the same measurement was performed.Results:Both the distance and the varus angles of the knee gap enlarged accordingly with the augment of distraction forces at both extension and flexion with or without {PCL} resection. As to the gap distance, it remained the same after {PCL} resection at extension; while at flexion, the gap distance significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) enlarged ? 1.2, 1.6 and 1.9 mm ? under 10, 20 and 30 in-lbf, respectively, after {PCL} resection. As to the varus angles, it significantly (p {\textless} .050) decreased 0.6°, 0.3° and 0.4° at extension; while at flexion, the varus angles decreased 0° (not significant), 0.6° (p {\textless} 0.050) and 1.1° (p {\textless} 0.001) with 10, 20 and 30 in-lbf, respectively, after {PCL} resection.Conclusion:Our study indicated that the sacrifice of {PCL} will decrease the varus deformity at both extension and flexion, but with the exception under low distraction force at flexion. A proper distraction tension is of great importance in gap balancing during {TKA}. Sufficient attention of varus differences should be paid to the gap balance technique when choosing from different techniques, {PCL}-retained {TKA} or {PCL}-sacrificed {TKA}, as well as and an appropriate distract tension during measurement.},

	abstract = {This article used probabilistic analysis to evaluate material properties of the in vivo subject-specific tibiofemoral ({TF}) joint model. Sensitivity analysis, based on a Monte Carlo ({MC}) method, was performed using a subject-specific finite element ({FE}) model generated from in vivo computed tomography ({CT}) and magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) data, subjected to two different loading conditions. Specifically, the effects of inherent uncertainty in ligament stiffness, horn attachment stiffness, and articular surface material properties were assessed using multifactorial global sensitivity analysis. The {MRI} images were taken before and after axial compression, and when the flexion condition had been maintained at up to 90 degree flexion in the subject-specific knee joint. The loading conditions of the probabilistic subject-specific {FE} model (axial compression and 90 degree flexion) were similar to the {MRI} acquisition setup. We were able to detect the influence of material parameters while maintaining the potential effect of parametric interactions. Throughout the in silico property optimization, a subject-specific {FE} model was used and less sensitive parameters were eliminated in the global sensitivity method. Soft tissue material properties were estimated using an optimization procedure that involved the minimization of the differences between the kinematics predicted by the subject-specific model and those obtained through in vivo subject-specific data.

	abstract = {Total knee arthroplasty ({TKA}) remains one of the most successful procedures in orthopaedic surgery. Complications certainly exist and are often related to failure of knee ligament balance. This asymmetry subsequently leads to component mal-alignment and loosening often secondary to deviation of the lower extremity mechanical axis. Understanding knee mechanics is essential, and recent technological advances have begun to minimize postoperative problems. A tensioning device that respects the native patellofemoral anatomy as well as the natural ligamentous strains has been developed. The surgical integration of computer- assisted navigation has allowed for enhanced accuracy and subsequently better results. The purpose of the current paper is to discuss the evolution of an improved ligament tensioning device, in the setting of classic mechanical guidance versus computer assistance and its postoperative impact on total knee outcomes in terms of manipulation rates and two-year radiographic alignment data. Based on a single surgeon series, mechanically guided arthroplasties resulted in a 16 per cent manipulation rate. Computer assistance with spacer blocks decreased the manipulation rate to 14 per cent, while using a novel tensioner device further decreased the manipulation rate to 7 per cent, a significant difference of p {\textless} 0.01. Radiographic data illustrate all {TKAs} with the tensioner to be within 4 degrees of the desired. position.},

A 134-N anterior force at 30° and 90° of flexion and combined valgus (8 N·m) and internal (4 N·m) rotation torques at 15° of flexion were applied simulating tests of anterior and rotatory stability. The {ACL} was sectioned at the femoral footprint by detaching either the higher band of fibers neighboring the lateral intercondylar ridge in the region of the direct insertion or the posterior, crescent-shaped fibers in the region of the indirect insertion, followed by the remainder of the {ACL}. The kinematics of the {ACL}-intact knee was replayed, and the reduction in force due to each sectioned portion of insertion fibers was measured. Isometry was assessed at anteromedial, center, and posterolateral locations within the high and low regions of the femoral footprint.Results:With an anterior tibial force at 30° of flexion, the high fibers carried 83.9\% of the total anterior {ACL} load compared with 16.1\% in the low fibers (P {\textless} .001). The high fibers also carried more anterior force than the low fibers at 90° of flexion (95.2\% vs 4.8\%; P {\textless} .001). Under combined torques at 15° of flexion, the high fibers carried 84.2\% of the anterior {ACL} force compared with 15.8\% in the low fibers (P {\textless} .001). Virtual {ACL} fibers placed at the anteromedial portion of the high region of the femoral footprint were the most isometric, with a maximum length change of 3.9 ± 1.5 mm.Conclusion:{ACL} fibers located high within the femoral footprint bear more force during stability testing and are more isometric during flexion than low fibers.Clinical Relevance:It may be advantageous to create a ?higher? femoral tunnel during {ACL} reconstruction at the lateral intercondylar ridge.},

	abstract = {Use of computational models with kinematic boundary conditions to study the knee joint contact behavior for normal and pathologic knee joints depends on an understanding of the impacts of kinematic uncertainty. We studied the sensitivities of tibio-menisco-femoral joint contact behavior to variations in knee kinematics using a finite element model ({FEM}) with geometry and kinematic boundary conditions derived from sequences of magnetic resonance ({MR}) images. The {MR} images were taken before and after axial compression was applied to the knee joint of a healthy subject. A design of experiments approach was used to study the impact of the variation in knee kinematics on the contact outputs. We also explored the feasibility of using supplementary hip images to improve the accuracy of knee kinematics. Variations in knee kinematics (0.25mm in medial–lateral, 0.1mm in anterior–posterior and superior–inferior translations, and 0.1° in flexion–extension and varus–valgus, 0.25° in external–internal rotations) caused large variations in joint contact behavior. When kinematic boundary conditions resulted in close approximations of the model-predicted joint contact force to the applied force, variations in predictions of contact parameters were also reduced. The combination of inferior–superior and medial–lateral translations accounted for over 70\% of variations for all the contact parameters examined. The inclusion of hip images in kinematic calculations improved knee kinematics by matching the femoral head position. Our findings demonstrate the importance of improving the accuracy and precision of knee kinematic measurements, especially when utilized as an input for finite element models.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine how the interaction between ligament tensions and contact forces guides the knee joint through its specific pattern of passive motion. A computer model was built based on cadaver data. The passive motion and the ligament lengthening and force patterns predicted by the model were verified with data from the literature. The contribution of each ligament and contact force was measured in terms of the rotational moment that it produced about the tibial medial plateau and the anterior-posterior ({AP}) force that it exerted on the tibia. The high tension of the anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) and the geometric constraints of the anterior horns of the menisci were found to be key features that stabilized the knee at full extension. The mutual effect of the cruciates was found as the reason for the screw-home mechanism at early flexion. Past 30 degrees, the {AP} component of contact force on the convex geometry of the lateral tibial plateau and tension of the lateral collateral ligament ({LCL}) were identified as elements that control the joint motion. From 60 degrees to 90 degrees, reduction in the tension of the {ACL} was determined as a reason for continuation of the tibial anterior translation. From 90 degrees to 120 degrees, increase in the tension of the posterior cruciate ligament and the {AP} component of the contact force on the convex geometry of the lateral tibial plateau pushed the tibia more anteriorly. This anterior translation was limited by the constraining effects of the {ACL} tension and the {AP} component of the contact force on the medial meniscus. The important guiding role observed for the {LCL} suggests that it should not be overlooked in knee models.},

However, comparisons using a standard {TKA} approach to normal knee joints that have not undergone bone resection are currently unavailable. Since bony preparation can influence capsule and ligament tension, our purpose was to perform measurements without this influence. Ten normal cadaveric knees were assessed using a standard medial parapatellar {TKA} approach with patellar subluxation. Gap measurements were carried out twice each alternating 100 and 200 N per compartment using a prototypical force-determining ligament balancer without the need for bony resection. Initial measurements were performed in extension, followed by 90° of flexion. The {ACL} was then resected, and finally the {PCL} was resected, and measurements were carried out in an analogous fashion. In general, the lateral compartment could be stretched further than the medial compartment, and the corresponding flexion gap values were significantly larger. {ACL} resection predominantly increased extension gaps, while {PCL} resection increased flexion gaps. Distraction force of 100 N per compartment appeared adequate; increasing to 200 N did not improve the results. © 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society. © 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {{BackgroundLigament} balancing is a challenging but essential part of successful total knee arthroplasty. There is general agreement that flexion and extension gaps should be equal and symmetrical. However, to date there are no available comparisons to physiologically normal knee joints that have not undergone bone resection. There are also no standards specifying which instruments (e.g., spacers, distractors, trial components, navigation systems) and particularly what degree of force should be used for gap distraction.{MethodsTo} measure the physiological extension and flexion gaps, a prototypical force-determining tensor (Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany) was constructed and adapted so that force could be applied directly through Schanz screws inserted medially and laterally on the tibia and femur, independent of each other and without the need for bony resection. Ten normal cadaveric knees were assessed using a standard medial parapatellar total knee arthroplasty approach with patellar subluxation. Gap measurements were carried out twice, alternating distraction forces of 100 and 200 N each time.{ResultsThe} prototype was implemented successfully. Repeat measurements showed only slight deviation from the original, resulting in minimal standard error. Precision did not vary with the application of greater force (200 N), but gap size increased significantly (p {\textless} 0.001).{ConclusionsThe} success of this assessment with cadaveric knees indicates that this prototype can be applied to measure flexion and extension gaps without the need for bony resection. Increasing the distraction force to 200 N does not improve results, so 100 N per compartment appears adequate. Most likely, the extension and flexion gaps are physiologically asymmetric and unequal, and the kinematics are markedly altered after resection of the {PCL} and/or {ACL}. This new force-determining tensor can be used for further analyses, e.g., to explore the effects of selective ligament resection.},

	abstract = {Ligament sprains account for a majority of injuries to the foot and ankle complex, but ligament properties have not been understood well due to the difficulties in replicating the complex geometry, in situ stress state, and non-uniformity of the strain. For a full investigation of the injury mechanism, it is essential to build up a foot and ankle model validated at the level of bony kinematics and ligament properties. This study developed a framework to parameterize the ligament response for determining the in situ stress state and heterogeneous force–elongation characteristics using a finite element ankle model. Nine major ankle ligaments and the interosseous membrane were modeled as discrete elements corresponding functionally to the ligamentous microstructure of collagen fibers and having parameterized toe region and stiffness at the fiber level. The range of the design variables in the ligament model was determined from existing experimental data. Sensitivity of the bony kinematics to each variable was investigated by design of experiment. The results highlighted the critical role of the length of the toe region of the ligamentous fibers on the bony kinematics with the cumulative influence of more than 95\%, while the fiber stiffness was statistically insignificant with an influence of less than 1\% under the given variable range and loading conditions. With the flexibility of variable adjustment and high computational efficiency, the presented ankle model was generic in nature so as to maximize its applicability to capture the individual ligament behaviors in future studies.},

Sixty-five varus osteoarthritic patients underwent primary posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty using modified gap-balancing technique. The influence of joint distraction force on the soft-tissue balance measurement during the modified gap-balancing technique was evaluated with Offset Repo-Tensor between the osteotomized surfaces at extension, and between femoral posterior condyles and tibial osteotomized surface at flexion of the knee before the resection of femoral posterior condyles. The joint center gap (millimeters) and varus ligament balance (°) were measured under 20, 40, and 60 pounds of joint distraction forces, and the differences in these values at extension and flexion (the value at flexion minus the value at extension) were also calculated. The differences in joint center gap (−6.7, −6.8, and −6.9 mm for 20, 40, and 60 pounds, respectively) and varus ligament balance (3.5°, 3.8°, and 3.8°) at extension and flexion were not significantly different among different joint distraction forces, although the joint center gap and varus ligament balance significantly increased stepwise at extension and flexion as the joint distraction force increased. The difference in joint center gap and varus ligament balance at extension and flexion were consistent even among the different joint distraction forces. This novel index would be useful for the determination of femoral component rotation during the modified gap-balancing technique.},

	abstract = {Background:The anteromedial ({AM}) bundle of the anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) has a higher modulus and failure stress than does the posterolateral ({PL}) bundle. However, it is unknown how these properties vary within each bundle.Purpose:To quantify mechanical and microstructural properties of samples within {ACL} bundles to elucidate any regional variation across the ligament. We hypothesized that there are no differences within each bundle in contrast to cross-bundle variation.Study Design:Descriptive laboratory study.Methods:Sixteen human {ACLs} were dissected into {AM} and {PL} bundles. Three samples were taken from each bundle in an ordered sequence from {AM} (region 1 {AM} bundle) to {PL} (region 6 {PL} bundle). Each sample was tested in uniaxial tension, using quantitative polarized light imaging ({QPLI}) to quantify collagen fiber alignment. After preconditioning, samples were subjected to a stress-relaxation ({SR}) test followed by quasistatic ramp-to-failure ({RF}). Peak and equilibrium stress values were computed from the {SR} test and modulus quantified in the toe- and linear-regions of the {RF}. {QPLI} values describing collagen orientation (angle of polarization [{AoP}]) and strength of alignment (degree of linear polarization [{DoLP}]) were computed for the {SR} test and at points corresponding to the zero, transition point, and linear region of the {RF}.Results:Toe- and linear-region modulus values decreased from region 1 to 6. Slopes of regression lines increased for the average {DoLP} during {RF}, with significance at higher strains. The standard deviation of {AoP} values decreased during {RF}, indicating tighter distribution of orientation angles, with significant correlations at all points of the {RF}. During {SR}, stress values uniformly decreased but did not show significant linear regression by region. {DoLP} and {AoP} values changed slightly during {SR} and demonstrated significant linear variation by region at both peak and equilibrium points.Conclusion:Most microstructural and material properties evaluated in this study appear to follow a linear gradient across the {ACL}, rather than varying by bundle.Clinical Relevance:This {AM}-to-{PL} variation provides a more accurate description of functional tissue anatomy and can be used to assess and guide techniques of {ACL} reconstruction.},

	abstract = {Knee laxity, defined as the net translation or rotation of the tibia relative to the femur in a given direction in response to an applied load, is highly variable from person to person. High levels of knee laxity as assessed during routine clinical exams are associated with first-time ligament injury and graft reinjury following reconstruction. During laxity exams, ligaments carry force to resist the applied load; however, relationships between intersubject variations in knee laxity and variations in how ligaments carry force as the knee moves through its passive envelope of motion, which we refer to as ligament engagement, are not well established. Thus, the objectives of this study were, first, to define parameters describing ligament engagement and, then, to link variations in ligament engagement and variations in laxity across a group of knees. We used a robotic manipulator in a cadaveric knee model (n=20) to quantify how important knee stabilizers, namely the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments ({ACL} and {PCL}, respectively), as well as the medial collateral ligament ({MCL}) engage during respective tests of anterior, posterior, and valgus laxity. Ligament engagement was quantified using three parameters: (1) in situ slack, defined as the relative tibiofemoral motion from the neutral position of the joint to the position where the ligament began to carry force; (2) in situ stiffness, defined as the slope of the linear portion of the ligament force–tibial motion response; and (3) ligament force at the peak applied load. Knee laxity was related to parameters of ligament engagement using univariate and multivariate regression models. Variations in the in situ slack of the {ACL} and {PCL} predicted anterior and posterior laxity, while variations in both in situ slack and in situ stiffness of the {MCL} predicted valgus laxity. Parameters of ligament engagement may be useful to further characterize the in situ biomechanical function of ligaments and ligament grafts.},

	abstract = {This study presents a subject-specific method of determining the zero-load lengths of the cruciate and collateral ligaments in computational knee modeling. Three cadaver knees were tested in a dynamic knee simulator. The cadaver knees also underwent manual envelope of motion testing to find their passive range of motion in order to determine the zero-load lengths for each ligament bundle. Computational multibody knee models were created for each knee and model kinematics were compared to experimental kinematics for a simulated walk cycle. One-dimensional non-linear spring damper elements were used to represent cruciate and collateral ligament bundles in the knee models. This study found that knee kinematics were highly sensitive to altering of the zero-load length. The results also suggest optimal methods for defining each of the ligament bundle zero-load lengths, regardless of the subject. These results verify the importance of the zero-load length when modeling the knee joint and verify that manual envelope of motion measurements can be used to determine the passive range of motion of the knee joint. It is also believed that the method described here for determining zero-load length can be used for in vitro or in vivo subject-specific computational models.},

	abstract = {Patient-to-patient differences should be accounted for in both clinical evaluations and computational models of knee laxity. Accordingly, the objectives were to determine how variable the laxities are between knees by determining the range of the internal–external (I-E), varus–valgus (V-V), anterior–posterior (A-P), and compression–distraction (C-D) limits of passive motion, and how related the laxities are within a knee by determining whether these limits are correlated with one another. The limits in I-E (± 3 Nm), V-V (± 5 Nm), A-P (± 45 N), and C-D (± 100 N) were measured in 10 normal human cadaveric knees at 0° to 120° flexion in 15° increments using a six degree-of-freedom load application system. The ranges from 15° to 120° flexion of the I-E limits were greater than 3.6°, of the A-P limits were greater than 1.8 mm, and of the varus limits were greater than 1.4°. The ranges from 30° to 120° flexion of the distraction limits were greater than 2.0 mm. Twenty-four of the 28 pair-wise comparisons between the limits had a correlation coefficient less than 0.65. These results demonstrate that a patient-specific approach, including all degrees of freedom of interest, is necessary during clinical evaluations of laxity and when creating and validating computational models of the tibiofemoral joint. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was twofold: first, to determine which muscles and ligaments resist the adduction moment at the knee during normal walking; and second, to describe and explain the contributions of muscles, ligaments, and the ground reaction force to medial and lateral compartment loading. Muscle forces, ground reaction forces, and joint motions obtained from a dynamic optimization solution for normal walking were used as input to a three-dimensional model of the lower limb. A static equilibrium problem was solved at each instant of the gait cycle to determine tibiofemoral joint loading at the knee. Medial compartment loading was determined mainly by the orientation of the ground reaction force. Because this force vector passed medial to the knee, it applied an adduction moment about the joint during stance. In contrast, all of the force transmitted by the lateral compartment was due to muscle and ligament action. The muscles that contributed most to support and forward propulsion during normal walking (quadriceps and gastrocnemius) also contributed most to knee stability in the frontal plane. The knee ligaments, particularly those of the posterior lateral corner, provided stability to the knee at certain periods of the stance phase, when activity of the important stabilizing muscles was low. © 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society.

	abstract = {Though asymmetric loading between the medial and lateral compartments of total knee replacements may contribute to implant loosening and failure, the in vivo contact force distribution during dynamic daily activities remains unknown. This study reports in vivo medial and lateral contact forces experienced by a well-aligned knee implant for a variety of activities. In vivo implant motion and total axial load data were collected from a single knee replacement patient performing treadmill gait (hands resting on handlebars), step up/down, lunge, and kneel activities. In vivo motion was measured using video fluoroscopy, while in vivo axial loads were collected simultaneously using an instrumented tibial component. An elastic foundation contact model employing linear and nonlinear polyethylene material properties was constructed to calculate medial and lateral contact forces based on the measured kinematics, total axial loads, and centers of pressure. For all activities, the predicted medial and lateral contact forces were insensitive to the selected material model. The percentage of medial to total contact force ranged from 18 to 60 for gait, 47 to 65 for step up/down, and 55 to 60 for kneel and lunge. At maximum load during the motion cycle, medial force was 1.2 {BW} for gait and 2.0 {BW} for step up/down, while the corresponding lateral forces were 1.0 and 1.5 {BW}, respectively. At mean load in the final static pose, medial force was 0.2 {BW} for kneel and 0.9 {BW} for lunge, with corresponding lateral forces of 0.1 and 0.7 {BW}, respectively. For this patient, a constant load split of 55\% medial–45\% lateral during loaded activity would be a reasonable approximation for these test conditions. © 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

	abstract = {In this paper, we sought to expand the fidelity of a validated model of the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ({ACL}-R) procedure by incorporating a stick–slip contact model with linear pressure–overclosure relationship at the interface. The suggested model is characterized by three unknown parameters, friction coefficient, shear stress softening and contact stiffness. In the absence of any isolated experiments exploring the graft–tunnel interactions during an aggregate joint load, the calibration data used in this study are derived from a reported biomechanical study. A Bayesian calibration procedure was employed to find the unknown probability distribution function ({PDF}) of these contact parameters. Initially, the response surface approximations of the predicted graft forces from laxity test simulations was adopted to estimate the likelihood of noisy experimental data reported in the literature. Then, the wide domain of contact parameters was sampled sequentially based on the Marcov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) method with acceptance–rejection criteria to search for population of samples in significantly narrower domain of unknown parameters that are associated with the highest occurrence likelihood of noisy experimental data. Our simulations with calibrated contact parameters indicate that pre-tensioning applied at 30° of flexion leads to larger graft force after the joint is fully extended compared to the graft force when the same pre-tensioning force is applied at full extension. Moreover, regardless of the pre-tensioning force, the graft–tunnel contact pressure is larger when the fixation of the graft is performed at full extension, increasing with the pre-tensioning force.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews and updates our knowledge of the anatomy and biomechanics of the posterior cruciate ligament, and of the posterolateral, posteromedial and meniscofemoral ligaments of the knee. The posterior cruciate ligament is shown to have two functional fibre bundles that are tight at different angles of knee flexion. It is the primary restraint to tibial posterior draw at all angles of knee flexion apart from near full extension. In contrast, the posterolateral and posteromedial structures are shown to tighten as the knee extends, and to be well-aligned to resist tibial posterior draw. These structures also act as primary restraints against other tibial displacements. Tibial internal rotation is restrained by the medial and posteromedial structures, while tibial external rotation is restrained by the lateral and posterolateral structures. They are also the primary restraints against tibial abduction-adduction rotations. The meniscofemoral ligaments are shown, for the first time, to contribute significantly to resisting tibial posterior draw, and to have a strength of approximately 300 N. Taken together, this evidence shows how the posterolateral and posteromedial structures are responsible for posterior knee stability near extension, and this, along with the action of the meniscofemoral ligaments, may explain why an isolated rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament does not often lead to knee instability},

	abstract = {Background: There is limited information regarding load responses of the posterior oblique and superficial medial collateral ligaments to applied loads., Hypotheses: The degree of knee flexion affects loads experienced by the posterior oblique ligament and both divisions of the superficial medial collateral ligament. The posterior oblique ligament provides significant resistance to valgus and internal rotation forces near knee extension. Different load responses are experienced by proximal and distal divisions of the superficial medial collateral ligament., Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study., Methods: Twenty-four nonpaired, fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were tested. Buckle transducers were applied to the proximal and distal divisions of the superficial medial collateral and posterior oblique ligaments. Applied loads at 0°, 20°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion consisted of 10 N.m valgus loads, 5 N .m internal and external rotation torques, and 88 N anterior and posterior drawer loads., Results: External rotation torques produced a significantly higher load response on the distal superficial medial collateral ligament than did internal rotation torques at all flexion angles with the largest difference at 90° (96.6 vs 22.5 N). For an applied valgus load at 60° of knee flexion, loads on the superficial medial collateral ligament were significantly higher in the distal division (103.5 N) than the proximal division (71.9 N). The valgus load response of the posterior oblique ligament at 0° of flexion (19.1 N) was significantly higher than at 30° (10.6 N), 60° (7.8 N), and 90° (6.8 N) of flexion. At 0° of knee flexion, the load response to internal rotation on the posterior oblique ligament (45.8 N) was significantly larger than was the response on both divisions of the superficial medial collateral ligament (20 N for both divisions). At 90° of flexion, the load response to internal rotation torques reciprocated between these structures with a significantly higher response in the distal superficial medial collateral ligament division (22.5 N) than the posterior oblique ligament (9.1 N)., Conclusion: The superficial medial collateral ligament experienced the largest load response to applied valgus and external rotation torques; the posterior oblique ligament observed the highest load response to internal rotation near extension., Clinical Relevance: This study provides new knowledge of the individual biomechanical function of the main medial knee structures in an intact knee and will assist in the interpretation of clinical knee motion testing and provide evidence for techniques involving repair or reconstruction of the posterior oblique ligament and both divisions of the superficial medial collateral ligament.},

It is vital that the simulation conditions match the physiological situation as closely as possible. To date, few experimental wear studies have examined the effects of joint laxity on wear and joint kinematics and the absence of the anterior cruciate ligament has not been sufficiently taken into account in simulator wear studies. The aim of this study was to investigate different ligament and soft tissue models with respect to wear and kinematics. A virtual soft tissue control system was used to simulate different motion restraints in a force-controlled knee wear simulator. The application of more realistic and sophisticated ligament models that considered the absence of anterior cruciate ligament lead to a significant increase in polyethylene wear (p=0.02) and joint kinematics (p{\textless}0.01). We recommend the use of more complex ligament models to appropriately simulate the function of the human knee joint and to evaluate the wear behavior of total knee replacements. A feasible simulation model is presented.},

This study examined the strength of the human posterior cruciate ligament ({PCL}), treating it as two separate fibre bundles. It was hypothesized (i) that the mechanical and material properties of the anterolateral ({aPC}) and the posteromedial ({pPC}) bundles of the {PCL} were significantly different and (ii) that previous studies have underestimated the strength of the whole {PCL}. The properties of the two bundles were measured in 10 donors (53–98 yr). The mechanical and material properties of the two bundles were found to be significantly different, the {aPC} was six times as strong as the {pPC}. The {aPC} had a mean strength of 1.6 {kN}. Allowing for age effects this study suggests that the strength of the {PCL} in young active people is 4 {kN}, which is higher than that suggested by previous studies. Because of the difference in the strengths of the two bundles, we conclude that the {aPC} is primarily responsible for the stabilising effect of the {PCL}. We therefore recommend that {PCL} reconstructions should be centered on the middle of the {aPC} bundle.},

	abstract = {Background
Previous studies suggested that changes in kinematics in total knee arthroplasty ({TKA}) affected satisfaction level. The aim of this cadaveric study was to evaluate the effect of medial collateral ligament ({MCL}) release by multiple needle puncture on knee rotational kinematics in posterior-stabilized {TKA}.
Methods
Six fresh, frozen cadaveric knees were included in this study. All {TKA} procedures were performed with an image-free navigation system using a 10-mm polyethylene insert. Tibial internal rotation was assessed to evaluate intraoperative knee kinematics. Multiple needle puncturing was performed 5, 10, and 15 times for the hard portion of the {MCL} at 90° knee flexion. Kinematic analysis was performed after every 5 punctures. After performing 15 punctures, a 14-mm polyethylene insert was inserted, and kinematic analysis was performed.
Results
The tibial internal rotation angle at maximum knee flexion without multiple needle puncturing was significantly larger (9.42°) than that after 15 punctures (3°). Negative correlation (Pearson r = −0.715, P \&lt; .001) between tibial internal rotation angle at maximum knee flexion and frequency of puncture was observed. The tibial internal rotation angle with a 14-mm insert was significantly larger (7.25°) compared with the angle after 15 punctures.
Conclusion
Tibial internal rotation during knee flexion was reduced by extensive {MCL} release using multiple needle puncturing and was recovered by increasing of medial tightness. From the point of view of knee kinematics, medial tightness should be allowed to maintain the internal rotation angle of the tibia during knee flexion which might lead to patient satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Background The posterior cruciate ligament ({PCL}) is the strongest ligament of the knee, serving as one of the major passive stabilizers of the tibio-femoral joint. However, despite a number of experimental and modelling approaches to understand the kinematics and kinetics of the ligament, the normal loading conditions of the {PCL} and its functional bundles are still controversially discussed.   Objectives This study aimed to generate science-based evidence for understanding the functional loading of the {PCL}, including the anterolateral and posteromedial bundles, in the healthy knee joint through systematic review and statistical analysis of the literature.   Data sources {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE} and {CENTRAL}   Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Databases were searched for articles containing any numerical strain or force data on the healthy {PCL} and its functional bundles. Studied activities were as follows: passive flexion, flexion under 100N and 134N posterior tibial load, walking, stair ascent and descent, body-weight squatting and forward lunge.   Method Statistical analysis was performed on the reported load data, which was weighted according to the number of knees tested to extract average strain and force trends of the {PCL} and identify deviations from the norms.   Results From the 3577 articles retrieved by the initial electronic search, only 66 met all inclusion criteria. The results obtained by aggregating data reported in the eligible studies indicate that the loading patterns of the {PCL} vary with activity type, knee flexion angle, but importantly also the technique used for assessment. Moreover, different fibres of the {PCL} exhibit different strain patterns during knee flexion, with higher strain magnitudes reported in the anterolateral bundle. While during passive flexion the posteromedial bundle is either lax or very slightly elongated, it experiences higher strain levels during forward lunge and has a synergetic relationship with the anterolateral bundle. The strain patterns obtained for virtual fibres that connect the origin and insertion of the bundles in a straight line show similar trends to those of the real bundles but with different magnitudes.   Conclusion This review represents what is now the best available understanding of the biomechanics of the {PCL}, and may help to improve programs for injury prevention, diagnosis methods as well as reconstruction and rehabilitation techniques.},

	abstract = {This study introduces a framework for co-simulating neuromuscular dynamics and knee joint mechanics during gait. A knee model was developed that included 17 ligament bundles and a representation of the distributed contact between a femoral component and tibial insert surface. The knee was incorporated into a forward dynamics musculoskeletal model of the lower extremity. A computed muscle control algorithm was then used to modulate the muscle excitations to drive the model to closely track measured hip, knee, and ankle angle trajectories of a subject walking overground with an instrumented knee replacement. The resulting simulations predicted the muscle forces, ligament forces, secondary knee kinematics, and tibiofemoral contact loads. Model-predicted tibiofemoral contact forces were of comparable magnitudes to experimental measurements, with peak medial (1.95 body weight ({BW})) and total (2.76 {BW}) contact forces within 4–17\% of measured values. Average root-mean-square errors over a gait cycle were 0.26, 0.42, and 0.51 {BW} for the medial, lateral, and total contact forces, respectively. The model was subsequently used to predict variations in joint contact pressure that could arise by altering the frontal plane joint alignment. Small variations (±2 deg) in the alignment of the femoral component and tibial insert did not substantially affect the location of contact pressure, but did alter the medio-lateral distribution of load and internal tibia rotation in swing. Thus, the computational framework can be used to virtually assess the coupled influence of both physiological and design factors on in vivo joint mechanics and performance.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional mathematical models of the tibio-femoral joint require input of the geometry of articulating surfaces and ligament insertions, and the mechanical properties of cartilage and ligaments. This paper describes a validation of a knee model through a direct specimen-related comparison between the knee model and the kinematics of four knee joint specimens from which the geometry data were used as input of the model. The knee model is quasi-static and is based on equilibrium of forces and moments. The stiffness properties of the ligaments and articular cartilage were estimated on the basis of data reported in the literature. The so-called reference strains in the ligament bundles for the joint in extension, were determined by using an optimization procedure, minimizing the difference between the kinematics of the model and the kinematics of experimentally obtained flexion motions with an internally or an externally rotated tibia (±3 Nm load). A reasonable to good agreement between the model and the experimental kinematics could be obtained for internal-external rotation laxity and the coupled translations and varus-valgus rotation. The disparity between model and experiment varied from knee to knee, average deviations ranging from close to zero to 8° internal rotation deviation and from 5 mm posterior to 3 mm anterior position deviation. The average anterior-posterior laxities at both 20° and 90° flexion were within the variations reported in the literature, although for each individual joint with some underestimation or overestimation. It was concluded that the optimization procedure compensated for the lack of menisci and capsular structures by higher prestrains, thereby overestimating the ligament forces. Despite the gross simplifications relative to the complex anatomy of the knee, the present knee model can realistically simulate the passive motion characteristics of the human knee joint.},

They are not isometric with the main change being lengthening of the {AMB} and shortening of the {PLB} during flexion. The {ACL} has a microstructure of collagen bundles of multiple types (mostly type I) and a matrix made of a network of proteins, glycoproteins, elastic systems, and glycosaminoglycans with multiple functional interactions. The complex ultrastructural organization and abundant elastic system of the {ACL} allow it to withstand multiaxial stresses and varying tensile strains.

	abstract = {Summary: The objective of this study was to provide quantitative data on the insertion sites of the cruciate ligaments. In the first part of the study, we determined the shapes and sizes of the insertions of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments ({ACL} and {PCL}), and further compared these data with the midsubstance cross-sectional areas of the ligaments. The cross-sectional area of the {ACL} and {PCL} midsubstance of 5 human knees was measured using a laser micrometer system. The insertion sites of each ligament were then digitized and the 2-dimensional insertion site areas were determined. Relative to the ligament midsubstance, the {PCL} tibial and femoral insertions were approximately 3 times larger, whereas those of the {ACL} were over 3.5 times larger. In the second part of the study, the {ACLs} and {PCLs} of 10 knees were each divided into their 2 components and the areas of each insertion were determined. Each component was approximately 50\% of the total ligament insertion area and no significant difference between the 2 could be shown.

The complex fiber anatomy of the cruciates may suggest a complex deformation behavior across the continuum of their substance that cannot be captured by only two measurement points. In this study, a new methodology was introduced to include more detailed fiber anatomy and to take into consideration the wrapping of the {PCL} around the intercondylar notch of the femur in deep flexion. The method was used in comparison to the conventional two-bundle models on three sample cadaver knees that underwent a passive flexion up to 150°. The elongation ratios of the bundles were measured as the ratio of change in the length of the bundles over their lengths at 0° flexion. The multiple-bundle models showed ranges of variations across the attachment sites of the cruciates which at all flexion angles were significantly larger than those observed from the conventional two-bundle models. When expressed in percentages, at 150° flexion the ranges of variations in the elongation ratio of the bundles were 32.7\% ± 31.9\% and 34\% ± 8.6\% for the {ACL} and {PCL}, respectively. Results of this study showed that important variations of elongation across the body of the cruciates can be obscured to the conventional two-bundle model of the cruciates, and therefore a more detailed bundle configuration is suggested for the purpose of studying elongation behaviors of these ligaments.},

	abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely
limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization,
since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded.
One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the
objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization,
tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface
methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often
occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct
an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response
surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by
sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where
prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which
have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be
overcome.},

	abstract = {The cruciate ligaments of the knee consist of numerous fascicles, groups of which comprise fibre bundles. The stabilising function of these ligaments is established by changes in the lengths and orientations of the fascicles. Understanding the function of knee ligaments thus requires an understanding of their 3-dimensional fascicle architecture. Hitherto, the cruciate ligaments have been considered functionally as single-dimensional 'ropes' or, at the most, as consisting of anterior and posterior parts. It is evident from the appearance of these ligamentous structures, however, that fascicles in more than 2 directions are present. This study investigated how many and which fibre bundles are minimally needed to preserve the main fascicle directions in the ligaments. An anatomical analysis of the cruciate ligaments was performed using a 3-dimensional measuring device. Three anterior and 3 posterior cruciate ligaments were isolated and their fascicles measures. Based on the courses of the fascicles, fibre bundles were defined, dissected bluntly, and their corresponding insertion sites measured. Finally, the insertion sites of the bundles were connected into straight-line representations by a computer and transformed to the anatomical position of the knee, so as to be useful for functional analyses of the ligaments. It was found that 6-10 bundles are sufficient to represent the main fascicle directions of the ligaments. Although the number of fibre bundles is not identical for all ligaments, the femur and the tibia are connected in a consistent way by these bundles. Even the ways in which the fibre bundles change their interrelationship from the femoral to the tibial insertion sites are comparable. The results serve as a detailed anatomical basis for functional analyses of the cruciate ligaments.},

	abstract = {Background: The posterior cruciate ligament ({PCL}) is composed of 2 functional bundles and has an essential role in knee function and stability. There is, however, a limited understanding of the role of each individual bundle through the full range of knee flexion.
Hypothesis: Both bundles provide restraint to posterior tibial translation across a full range of knee flexion. At higher angles of knee flexion ({\textgreater}90°), the intact {PCL} also imparts significant rotational stability.
Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.
Methods: Twenty matched-paired, human cadaveric knees (mean age, 55.2 years; range, 51-59 years; 6 male and 4 female pairs) were used to evaluate the kinematics of an intact, anterolateral bundle ({ALB}) sectioned, posteromedial bundle ({PMB}) sectioned, and complete {PCL} sectioned knee. A 6 degree of freedom robotic system was used to assess knee stability with an applied 134-N posterior tibial load, 5-N·m external and internal rotation torques, 10-N·m valgus and varus torques, and a coupled 100-N posterior tibial load and 5-N external rotation torque at 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, 90°, 105°, and 120°.
Results: All sectioned states had significant increases compared with intact in posterior translation, internal rotation, and external rotation at all tested flexion angles, with the exception of the {ALB} sectioned state at 75° of flexion for external rotation. The significant increases (mean ± standard deviation) in posterior translation during a 134-N posterior tibial load at 90° of flexion were 0.9 ± 0.6 mm, 2.6 ± 1.8 mm, and 11.7 ± 4.0 mm for the {PMB}, {ALB}, and complete {PCL} sectioned states, respectively, compared with the intact state. The largest significant increases in internal rotation were in the {PMB} and complete {PCL} sectioned states at 105° of flexion, 1.3° ± 1.0° and 2.8° ± 2.1°, respectively.
Conclusion: Both the {ALB} and the {PMB} assume a significant role in resisting posterior tibial translation, at all flexion angles, suggesting a codominant relationship. The {PCL} provided a significant constraint to internal rotation beyond 90° of flexion.
Clinical Relevance: This information broadens the understanding of native knee kinematics and provides a template for the evaluation of single- and double-bundle {PCL} reconstructions.},

Previous studies on the collateral ligaments have focused on quantifying strain and tension properties under discrete loads or kinematic paths; however, there has been little work to quantify collateral ligament contribution over a broad range of applied loads and range of motion ({ROM}) in passive constraint. To accomplish this, passive envelopes were collected from nine cadaveric knees instrumented with implantable pressure transducers ({IPT}) in the collateral ligaments. The contributions from medial and lateral collateral ligaments ({LCL}) were quantified by the relative contribution of each structure at various flexion angles (0–120 deg) and compound external loads (±10 N m valgus, ±8 N m external, and ±40 N anterior). Average medial collateral ligament ({MCL}) contributions were highest under external and valgus torques from 60 deg to 120 deg flexion. The {MCL} showed significant contributions to {TJC} under external torques throughout the flexion range. Average {LCL} contributions were highest from 0 deg to 60 deg flexion under external and varus torques, as well as internal torques from 60 deg to 110 deg flexion. Similarly, these regions were found to have statistically significant {LCL} contributions. Anterior and posterior loads generally reduced collateral contribution to {TJC}; however, posterior loads further reduced {MCL} contribution, while anterior loads further reduced {LCL} contribution. These results provide insight to the functional role of the collaterals over a broad range of passive constraint. Developing a map of collateral ligament contribution to {TJC} may be used to identify the effects of injury or surgical intervention on soft-tissue, and how collateral ligament contributions to constraint correlate with activities of daily living.},

Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to develop rigid {EF} and deformable {FE} models of tibiofemoral contact, and to compare predicted kinematics and contact mechanics from both representations during gait loading conditions with three different implant designs. Linear and nonlinear contact pressure-surface overclosure relationships based on polyethylene material properties were developed using {EF} theory. All other variables being equal, rigid body {FE} models accurately estimated kinematics predicted by fully deformable {FE} models and required only 2\% of the analysis time. As expected, the linear {EF} contact model sufficiently approximated trends for peak contact pressures, but overestimated the deformable results by up to 30\%. The nonlinear {EF} contact model more accurately reproduced trends and magnitudes of the deformable analysis, with maximum differences of approximately 15\% at the peak pressures during the gait cycle. All contact area predictions agreed in trend and magnitude. Using rigid models, edge-loading conditions resulted in substantial overestimation of peak pressure. Optimal nonlinear {EF} contact relationships were developed for specific {TKR} designs for use in parametric or repetitive analyses where computational time is paramount. The explicit {FE} analysis method utilized here provides a unique approach in that both rigid and deformable analyses can be run from the same input file, thus enabling simple selection of the most appropriate representation for the analysis of interest.},

	abstract = {Background
In total knee surgery, typically the bone cuts are made first to produce the correct overall alignment. This is followed by balancing, often using spacer blocks to obtain equal parallel gaps in flexion and extension. Recently an electronically instrumented tibial trial has been introduced, which measures lateral and medial contact forces. The goal of our study was to determine the effect of different surgical variables; changing component sizes, modifying bone cuts, or ligament releases; on the contact forces, as a method to achieve balancing.
Methods
A special rig was designed to fit on a standard operating table, on which tests on 10 lower extremity specimens were carried out. After making bone cuts for a posterior cruciate retaining knee using a navigation system, tibial thickness was determined in extension using the Sag Test. Different Surgical Variables were then implemented, and the changes in the condylar forces were determined throughout flexion using the Heel Push Test.
Results
condylar forces were found to consist of gravity forces due to the weight of the leg plus forces due to pretension in the collateral ligaments. The pretension force averaged 145 N but there was considerable variation because of ligament stiffness properties. Balancing from an imbalanced state could be achieved with adjustments within only 2° or 2 mm.
Conclusion
The instrumented tibial trial provided force information which indicated which surgical correction options to carry out to achieve balancing. From an initial unbalanced state, relatively small changes could produce balancing, indicating the sensitivity of the procedure.
Clinical Relevance
Non-clinical. This study will assist in the balancing of the knee at total knee replacement surgery.},

	abstract = {In vitro pre-clinical testing of total knee replacement ({TKR}) devices is a necessary step in the evaluation of new implant designs. Whole joint knee simulators, like the Kansas knee simulator ({KKS}), provide a controlled and repeatable loading environment for comparative evaluation of component designs or surgical alignment under dynamic conditions. Experimental testing, however, is time and cost prohibitive for design-phase evaluation of tens or hundreds of design variations. Experimentally-verified computational models provide an efficient platform for analysis of multiple components, sizes, and alignment conditions. The purpose of the current study was to develop and verify a computational model of a dynamic, whole joint knee simulator. Experimental internal–external and valgus–varus laxity tests, followed by dynamic deep knee bend and gait simulations in the {KKS} were performed on three cadaveric specimens. Specimen-specific finite element ({FE}) models of posterior-stabilized {TKR} were created from magnetic resonance images and {CAD} geometry. The laxity data was used to optimize mechanical properties of tibiofemoral soft-tissue structures on a specimen-specific basis. Each specimen was subsequently analyzed in a computational model of the experimental {KKS}, simulating both dynamic activities. The computational model represented all joints and actuators in the experimental setup, including a proportional-integral-derivative ({PID}) controller to drive quadriceps actuation. The computational model was verified against six degree-of-freedom patellofemoral ({PF}) and tibiofemoral ({TF}) kinematics and actuator loading during both deep knee bend and gait activities, with good agreement in trends and magnitudes between model predictions and experimental kinematics; differences were less than 1.8 mm and 2.2° for {PF} and {TF} translations and rotations. The whole joint {FE} simulator described in this study can be applied to investigate a wide range of clinical and research questions.},

	abstract = {In 1879, the French surgeon Segond described the existence of a ‘pearly, resistant, fibrous band’ at the anterolateral aspect of the human knee, attached to the eponymous Segond fracture. To date, the enigma surrounding this anatomical structure is reflected in confusing names such as ‘(mid-third) lateral capsular ligament’, ‘capsulo-osseous layer of the iliotibial band’ or ‘anterolateral ligament’, and no clear anatomical description has yet been provided. In this study, the presence and characteristics of Segond's ‘pearly band’, hereafter termed anterolateral ligament ({ALL}), was investigated in 41 unpaired, human cadaveric knees. The femoral and tibial attachment of the {ALL}, its course and its relationship with nearby anatomical structures were studied both qualitatively and quantitatively. In all but one of 41 cadaveric knees (97\%), the {ALL} was found as a well-defined ligamentous structure, clearly distinguishable from the anterolateral joint capsule. The origin of the {ALL} was situated at the prominence of the lateral femoral epicondyle, slightly anterior to the origin of the lateral collateral ligament, although connecting fibers between the two structures were observed. The {ALL} showed an oblique course to the anterolateral aspect of the proximal tibia, with firm attachments to the lateral meniscus, thus enveloping the inferior lateral geniculate artery and vein. Its insertion on the anterolateral tibia was grossly located midway between Gerdy's tubercle and the tip of the fibular head, definitely separate from the iliotibial band ({ITB}). The {ALL} was found to be a distinct ligamentous structure at the anterolateral aspect of the human knee with consistent origin and insertion site features. By providing a detailed anatomical characterization of the {ALL}, this study clarifies the long-standing enigma surrounding the existence of a ligamentous structure connecting the femur with the anterolateral tibia. Given its structure and anatomic location, the {ALL} is hypothesized to control internal tibial rotation and thus to affect the pivot shift phenomenon, although further studies are needed to investigate its biomechanical function.},

	abstract = {Modeling complex knee biomechanics is a continual challenge, which has resulted in many models of varying levels of quality, complexity, and validation. Beyond modeling healthy knees, accurately mimicking pathologic knee mechanics, such as after cruciate rupture or meniscectomy, is difficult. Experimental tests of knee laxity can provide important information about ligament engagement and overall contributions to knee stability for development of subject-specific models to accurately simulate knee motion and loading. Our objective was to provide combined experimental tests and finite-element ({FE}) models of natural knee laxity that are subject-specific, have one-to-one experiment to model calibration, simulate ligament engagement in agreement with literature, and are adaptable for a variety of biomechanical investigations (e.g., cartilage contact, ligament strain, in vivo kinematics). Calibration involved perturbing ligament stiffness, initial ligament strain, and attachment location until model-predicted kinematics and ligament engagement matched experimental reports. Errors between model-predicted and experimental kinematics averaged {\textless}2 deg during varus–valgus ({VV}) rotations, {\textless}6 deg during internal–external ({IE}) rotations, and {\textless}3 mm of translation during anterior–posterior ({AP}) displacements. Engagement of the individual ligaments agreed with literature descriptions. These results demonstrate the ability of our constraint models to be customized for multiple individuals and simultaneously call attention to the need to verify that ligament engagement is in good general agreement with literature. To facilitate further investigations of subject-specific or population based knee joint biomechanics, data collected during the experimental and modeling phases of this study are available for download by the research community.},

Specifically, the effects of inherent uncertainty in ligament stiffness, reference strain and attachment site locations on joint constraint were assessed. An explicit finite element model of the knee was evaluated under a series of anterior-posterior ({AP}) and internal-external ({IE}) loading at full extension and 90° flexion. Distributions of {AP} and {IE} laxity were predicted using experimentally-based levels of ligament parameter variability. Importance factors identified the critical properties affecting the predicted bounds, and agreed with reported ligament recruitment.

	abstract = {During knee motion, the fiber bundles of ligaments are nonuniformly loaded in a recruitment pattern which is different for successive knee-joint positions. As a result, the restraining functions of these ligaments are variable. To analyze the relative restraint contributions of the fiber bundles in different knee-joint positions, a new method was developed. Its application was illustrated for the cruciate ligaments of one knee-joint specimen. The methods developed to estimate bundle forces comprise five steps. First, the three-dimensional motions of a knee specimen are measured for anterior-posterior forces, using Röntgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis. Second, bone-ligament-bone tensile tests are performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of these structures in several relative orientations of the bones. Third, multiple fiber bundles are identified in each ligament, based on the main fiber orientations. Fourth, the nonlinear force-length relationship of each functional bundle, as defined by a stiffness and a recruitment parameter, is determined by combining the multidirectional tensile tests with a multiline-element ligament model. Finally, the information obtained is combined in a whole-joint computer model of the knee, to determine the internal forces in the initial kinematic experiment, using an inverse dynamics approach. The technique appeared to be extremely time consuming and technologically involved. However, it was demonstrated to be useful and effective. The preliminary results reveal that the fiber bundle restraints are extremely sensitive to the knee flexion angle and the restraining forces are highly variable within the ligaments. For both cruciate ligaments, a gradual transition was demonstrated in load transfer from the posterior bundles to the more anteriorly positioned ones during knee flexion. Furthermore, it appeared that relatively high rorces were carried by only a few fiber bundles at each flexion angle. Based on these preliminary results, it is concluded that the determination of forces in multiple ligament bundles is important for the understanding of failure mechanisms of ligaments. In particular, alternate loading of different fiber bundles suggests that successful operative reconstruction of the cruciate ligaments may not be achieved simply by a one-bundle preparation.},

The pathogenesis of osteoarthritis following anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) reconstruction is currently unknown. The study purpose was to leverage recent advances in quantitative and dynamic {MRI} to test the hypothesis that abnormal joint mechanics within four years of reconstruction is accompanied by evidence of early compositional changes in cartilage.
Methods
Static {MR} imaging was performed bilaterally on eleven subjects with an {ACL} reconstruction (1–4 years post-surgery) and on twelve healthy subjects to obtain tibial cartilage thickness maps. Quantitative imaging ({mcDESPOT}) was performed unilaterally on all subjects to assess the fraction of bound water in the tibial plateau cartilage. Finally, volumetric dynamic imaging was performed to assess cartilage contact patterns during an active knee flexion–extension task. A repeated-measures {ANOVA} was used to test for the effects of surgical reconstruction and location on cartilage thickness, bound water fractions, and contact across the medial and lateral tibia plateaus.
Findings
No significant differences in cartilage thickness were found between groups. However, there was a significant reduction in the fraction of water bound by proteoglycan in the {ACL} reconstructed knees, most notably along the anterior portion of the medial plateau and the weight-bearing lateral plateau. During movement, reconstructed knees exhibited greater contact along the medial spine in the medial plateau and along the posterior aspect of the lateral plateau, when compared with their healthy contralateral knees and healthy controls.
Interpretation
This study provides evidence that abnormal mechanics in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed knees are present coincidently with early biomarkers of cartilage degeneration.},

However, it is unknown if the two bundles of the {ACL} exhibit distinct time-dependent properties and microstructural organization, which have important implications for fully understanding the structure-function relationships of this oft-injured ligament. The goal of this study was to quantify the viscoelastic material properties and collagen fiber alignment of the {AM} and {PL} bundles in 16 human {ACLs} during stress-relaxation mechanical tests using the quasi-linear viscoelastic ({QLV}) model and a quantitative polarization imaging technique. We hypothesized that the {AM} and {PL} bundles would exhibit differences in the instantaneous mechanical and organizational properties (i.e., immediately following a step increase in strain), but similar time-dependent changes during stress-relaxation. Results showed that {AM} samples exhibited larger peak/equilibrium stresses and less stress-relaxation during a 300-s hold compared to {PL} samples. The {AM} bundle demonstrated stronger and more uniform collagen fiber alignment (i.e., higher degree of linear polarization ({DoLP}) values and less distributed angle of polarization ({AoP}) values) compared to the {PL} bundle, and larger changes in alignment strength during the hold. Results suggest that the {AM} bundle is the more “dominant” bundle, with significantly different mechanical and material properties in stress-relaxation. While more research is needed to better understand how these findings relate to the pathophysiology of {ACL} tears and can best guide treatment, the findings provide additional insight into the microstructural properties and biomechanics of the human {ACL}.},

The objective of this study was to use a multibody knee model to investigate the influence of ligament properties on tibiofemoral kinematics and cartilage contact pressures in the stance phase of walking. The knee model included 14 ligament bundles and articular cartilage contact acting across the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints. The knee was incorporated into a lower extremity musculoskeletal model and was used to simulate knee mechanics during the stance phase of normal walking. A Monte Carlo approach was employed to assess the influence of ligament stiffness and reference strain on knee mechanics. The anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}), medial collateral ligament ({MCL}), and posterior capsule properties exhibited significant influence on anterior tibial translation at heel strike, with the {ACL} acting as the primary restraint to anterior translation in mid-stance. The {MCL} and lateral collateral ligament ({LCL}) exhibited the greatest influence on tibial rotation from heel strike through mid-stance. Simulated tibial plateau contact location was dependent on the {ACL}, {MCL}, and {LCL} properties, while pressure magnitudes were most dependent on the {ACL}. A decrease in {ACL} stiffness or reference strain significantly increased the average contact pressure in mid-stance, with the pressure migrating posteriorly on the medial tibial plateau. These ligament-dependent shifts in tibiofemoral cartilage contact during walking are potentially relevant to consider when investigating the causes of early-onset osteoarthritis following knee ligament injury and surgical treatment.},

	abstract = {Multiple computational models have been developed to study knee biomechanics. However, the majority of these models are mainly validated against a limited range of loading conditions and/or do not include sufficient details of the critical anatomical structures within the joint. Due to the multifactorial dynamic nature of knee injuries, anatomic finite element ({FE}) models validated against multiple factors under a broad range of loading conditions are necessary. This study presents a validated {FE} model of the lower extremity with an anatomically accurate representation of the knee joint. The model was validated against tibiofemoral kinematics, ligaments strain/force, and articular cartilage pressure data measured directly from static, quasi-static, and dynamic cadaveric experiments. Strong correlations were observed between model predictions and experimental data (r {\textgreater} 0.8 and p {\textless} 0.0005 for all comparisons). {FE} predictions showed low deviations (root-mean-square ({RMS}) error) from average experimental data under all modes of static and quasi-static loading, falling within 2.5 deg of tibiofemoral rotation, 1\% of anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) and medial collateral ligament ({MCL}) strains, 17 N of {ACL} load, and 1 mm of tibiofemoral center of pressure. Similarly, the {FE} model was able to accurately predict tibiofemoral kinematics and {ACL} and {MCL} strains during simulated bipedal landings (dynamic loading). In addition to minimal deviation from direct cadaveric measurements, all model predictions fell within 95\% confidence intervals of the average experimental data. Agreement between model predictions and experimental data demonstrates the ability of the developed model to predict the kinematics of the human knee joint as well as the complex, nonuniform stress and strain fields that occur in biological soft tissue. Such a model will facilitate the in-depth understanding of a multitude of potential knee injury mechanisms with special emphasis on {ACL} injury.},

	abstract = {Healthy patellofemoral ({PF}) joint mechanics are critical to optimal function of the knee joint. Patellar maltracking may lead to large joint reaction loads and high stresses on the articular cartilage, increasing the risk of cartilage wear and the onset of osteoarthritis. While the mechanical sources of {PF} joint dysfunction are not well understood, links have been established between {PF} tracking and abnormal kinematics of the tibiofemoral ({TF}) joint, specifically following cruciate ligament injury and repair. The objective of this study was to create a validated finite element ({FE}) representation of the {PF} joint in order to predict {PF} kinematics and quadriceps force across healthy and pathological specimens. Measurements from a series of dynamic in-vitro cadaveric experiments were used to develop finite element models of the knee for three specimens. Specimens were loaded under intact, {ACL}-resected and both {ACL} and {PCL}-resected conditions. Finite element models of each specimen were constructed and calibrated to the outputs of the intact knee condition, and subsequently used to predict {PF} kinematics, contact mechanics, quadriceps force, patellar tendon moment arm and patellar tendon angle of the cruciate resected conditions. Model results for the intact and cruciate resected trials successfully matched experimental kinematics (avg. {RMSE} 4.0°, 3.1 mm) and peak quadriceps forces (avg. difference 5.6\%). Cruciate resections demonstrated either increased patellar tendon loads or increased joint reaction forces. The current study advances the standard for evaluation of {PF} mechanics through direct validation of cruciate-resected conditions including specimen-specific representations of {PF} anatomy.},

	abstract = {Although variability in connective tissue parameters is widely reported and recognized, systematic examination of the effect of such parametric uncertainties on predictions derived from a full anatomical joint model is lacking. As such, a sensitivity analysis was performed to consider the behavior of a three-dimensional, non-linear, finite element knee model with connective tissue material parameters that varied within a given interval. The model included the coupled mechanics of the tibio-femoral and patello-femoral degrees of freedom. Seven primary connective tissues modeled as non-linear continua, articular cartilages described by a linear elastic model, and menisci modeled as transverse isotropic elastic materials were included. In this study, a multi-factorial global sensitivity analysis is proposed, which can detect the contribution of influential material parameters while maintaining the potential effect of parametric interactions. To illustrate the effect of material uncertainties on model predictions, exemplar loading conditions reported in a number of isolated experimental paradigms were used. Our findings illustrated that the inclusion of material uncertainties in a coupled tibio-femoral and patello-femoral model reveals biomechanical interactions that otherwise would remain unknown. For example, our analysis revealed that the effect of anterior cruciate ligament parameter variations on the patello-femoral kinematic and kinetic response sensitivities was significantly larger, over a range of flexion angles, when compared to variations associated with material parameters of tissues intrinsic to the patello-femoral joint. We argue that the systematic sensitivity framework presented herein will help identify key material uncertainties that merit further research and provide insight on those uncertainties that may not be as relative to a given response.},

	abstract = {Background

The posterolateral graft has been reported to fail more frequently than the anteromedial graft in double-bundle {ACL} reconstructions. This study investigated the graft kinematics using a 3D modelling technique.


Methods

Twenty subjects performed a stair-ascending activity under dual fluoroscopy surveillance. A double-bundle {ACL} reconstruction was simulated on those healthy knees using an anteromedial portal technique. The graft–tunnel interaction was described using the graft–tunnel angle and the range of the graft–tunnel edge contact ({GTEC}).


Results

The femoral graft–tunnel angle of the anteromedial/posterolateral graft was 97.6 ± 7.5/100.7 ± 7.7° and the tibial graft–tunnel angle was 158.8 ± 6.5/146.5 ± 8.9° at knee extension. The femoral {GTEC} ranges were 23.2 ± 5.3–28.1 ± 7.6° for both grafts and the tibial {GTEC} ranges were 27.3 ± 2.2–34.5 ± 2.1° during stair-ascending.


Conclusion

The femoral graft–tunnel angle was larger than on the tibial side and the {GTEC} angles influenced the {PL} graft more, implying that grafts may experience a less optimal biomechanical environment at the femoral tunnels. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The musculoskeletal ligament is a kind of multiscale composite material with collagen fibers embedded in a ground matrix. As the major constituent in ligaments to bear external loads, collagens are composed mainly of two collagen contents with different mechanical properties, i.e., types I and {III} collagen. The constitutive relation of ligaments plays a critical role in the stability and normal function of human joints. However, collagen types have not been distinguished in the previous constitutive relations. In this paper a constitutive relation for ligament tissues was modified based on the previous constitutive relation by considering the effects of collagen types. Both the collagen contents and the mechanical properties of sixteen ligament specimens from four cadaveric human knee joints were measured for determining their material coefficients in the constitutive relation. The mechanical behaviors of ligaments were obtained from both the uniaxial tensile and simple shear tests. A linear regression between joint kinematic results from in vitro and in silico experiments was made to validate the accuracy of this constitutive relation. The high correlation coefficient (R2=0.93) and significance (P\&lt;0.0001) of the regression equation revealed that this modified constitutive relation of ligaments was accurate to be used in studying joint biomechanics. Another finite element analysis with collagen contents changing demonstrated that the effect of variations in collagen ratios on both joint kinematics and ligament biomechanics could be simulated by this constitutive relation.},

	abstract = {In order to evaluate the contribution of the knee ligaments to restrain joint motions, knowledge about their structural properties is required. Due to the variable relative insertion orientation of the ligaments during knee motion, however, different fiber bundles are recruited, each with their specific mechanical properties. Hence, the structural properties vary as a function of knee motion. For this reason, a relationship between the structural tensile properties and the relative insertion orientation is required in order to define the role of the ligaments in knee mechanics. In the present study, this relationship is determined by performing a series of tensile tests in which the relative orientations of the insertion sites of human knee bone-ligament-bone preparations were varied systematically.

The experimentally obtained stiffness was significantly affected by the relative orientation of the insertion sites, but more profoundly for the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments ({ACL} and {PCL}) as compared to the medial and lateral collateral ligaments ({MCL} and {LCL}). The average decreases in stiffness per 5° tilt of the insertion sites were estimated at −11.6 ± 3.5 N mm−1 ({ACL}), −20.9 ± 2.7 N mm−1 ({PCL}), −2.6 ± 0.9 N mm−1 ({MCL}) and −3.7 ± 0.3 N mm−1 ({LCL}). For the {PCL} and the {MCL} these changes in stiffness with tilt were rather insensitive to the side of the femoral insertion site which was lifted. The {ACL} and the {LCL}, conversely, displayed significant differences in stiffness changes between the different tilt directions.

It is shown that the results of ligament tensile tests, particularly of the cruciate ligaments, are extremely sensitive to the orientation of the specimens in the loading apparatus. Since there is bound to be a variation in ligament orientations in earlier tensile studies, the variation in properties reported can be explained. It is concluded that the functional roles of the ligaments, particularly the cruciate ligaments, vary considerably during knee motions. Hence, functionally speaking, there is no such thing as ‘the ligament stiffness’.},

These experiments were used to enforce the particular boundary conditions used in the numerical model. A previously developed transversely isotropic hyperelastic material model was implemented and the ability to pre-stress the ligament was also included. The model exhibited the key characteristics of connective soft tissues: anisotropy, nonlinear behaviour, large strains, very high compliance for compressive or bending loading along the collagen fibres and incompressibility. Simulations of passive knee flexion were performed, with and without pre-stressing the {ACL}. The resultant force generated by the {ACL} was monitored and the results compared to existing experimental data. The stress distribution within the ligament was also assessed. When the {ACL} was pre-stressed, there was a good correlation between the predicted and experimental resultant forces reported in the literature over the entire flexion–extension range. The stress distribution in the pre-stressed and stress-free {ACL} were similar, although the magnitudes in the pre-stressed {ACL} were higher, particularly at low flexion angles.},

	abstract = {The ability to measure in vivo knee kinematics accurately makes it tempting to calculate in vivo contact forces, pressures, and areas directly from kinematic data. However, the sensitivity of contact calculations to kinematic measurement errors has not been adequately investigated. To address this issue, we developed a series of sensitivity analyses derived from a validated in vivo computational simulation of gait. The simulation used an elastic foundation contact model to reproduce in vivo contact force, center of pressure, and fluoroscopic motion data collected from an instrumented knee replacement. Treating each degree of freedom ({DOF}) in the simulation as motion controlled, we first quantified how errors in measured relative pose of the implant components affected contact calculations. Pose variations of ±0.1 mm or degree over the entire gait cycle changed maximum contact force, pressure, and area by 204, 100, and 117\%, respectively. Larger variations of ±0.5 mm or degree changed these same quantities by 1157, 108, and 578\%, respectively. In both cases, the largest sensitivities were to errors in superior-inferior translation and varus-valgus rotation, with loss of contact occurring on one or both sides. We then quantified how switching the sensitive {DOFs} from motion to load control affected the sensitivity results. Pose variations of ±0.5 mm or degree in the remaining {DOFs} changed maximum contact quantities by at most 3\%. These results suggest that accuracy on the order of microns and milliradians is needed to estimate contact forces, pressures, and areas directly from in vivo kinematic measurements, and that use of load rather than motion control for the sensitive {DOFs} may improve the accuracy of in vivo contact calculations. © 2008 Orthopaedic Research Society.

In vivo joint loads have been measured for a small number of telemetric {TKR} patients, but in order to assess device performance across the entire patient population, a larger patient cohort is necessary. This study investigates the accuracy of predicting joint loads from joint kinematics. Specifically, the objective of the study was to assess the accuracy of internal–external (I–E) and anterior–posterior (A–P) joint load predictions from I–E and A–P motions under a given compressive load, and to evaluate the repeatability of joint load ratios (I–E torque to compressive force (I–E:C), and A–P force to compressive force (A–P:C)) for a range of compressive loading profiles. A tibiofemoral finite element model was developed and used to simulate deep knee bend, chair-rise and step-up activities for five patients. Root-mean-square ({RMS}) differences in I–E:C and A–P:C load ratios between telemetric measurements and model predictions were less than 1.10e–3 Nm/N and 0.035 N/N for all activities. I–E:C and A–P:C load ratios were consistently reproduced regardless of the compressive force profile applied ({RMS} differences less than 0.53e–3 Nm/N and 0.010 N/N, respectively). When error in kinematic measurement was introduced to the model, joint load predictions were forgiving to kinematic measurement error when conformity between femoral and tibial components was low. The prevalence of kinematic data, in conjunction with the analysis presented here, facilitates determining the scope of A–P and I–E joint loading ratios experienced by the {TKR} population.},

	abstract = {The ligaments of the knee consist of fiber bundles with variable orientations, lengths and mechanical properties. In concept, however, these structures were too often seen as homogeneous structures, which are either stretched or slack during knee motions. In previous studies, we proposed a new structural concept of the ligaments of the knee. In this concept, the ligaments were considered as multi-bundle structures, with nonuniform mechanical properties and zero force lengths. The purpose of the present study was to verify this new concept.

For this purpose, laxity characteristics of a human knee joint were compared as measured in an experiment and predicted in a model simulation study. In the experiment, the varus-valgus and anterior-posterior laxities of a knee-joint specimen containing the ligaments and the articular surfaces only, were determined. From this knee-joint, geometric and mechanical parameters were derived to supply the parameters for a three-dimensional quasi-static knee-joint model. These parameters included (i) the three-dimensional insertion points of bundles, defined in the four major knee ligaments, (ii) the mechanical properties of these ligament, as functions of their relative insertion orientations and (iii) three-dimensional representations of the articular surfaces. With this model the experiments were simulated. If knee-model predictions and experimental results agree, then the multi-bundle ligament models are validated, at least with respect to their functional role in anterior-posterior and varus-valgus loading of the joint.

The model described the laxity characteristics in {AP}-translation and {VV}-rotation of the cadaveric knee-joint specimen reasonably well. Both display the same patterns of laxity changes during knee flexion. Only if a varus moment of 8 N m was applied and if the tibia was posteriorly loaded, did the model predict a slightly higher laxity than that measured experimentally.

From the model-experiment comparisons it was concluded that the proposed structural representations of the ligaments and their mechanical property distributions seem to be valid for studying the anterior-posterior and varus-valgus laxity characteristics of the human knee-joint.},

Apart from the obvious acute injury events, it also presents with significant long-term morbidities, in which osteoarthritis ({OA}) is a frequent and debilitative outcome. With these facts in mind, a vast amount of research has been undertaken over the past five decades geared toward characterizing the structural and mechanical behaviors of the native {ACL} tissue under various external load applications. While these efforts have afforded important insights, both in terms of understanding treating and rehabilitating {ACL} injuries; injury rates, their well-established sex-based disparity, and long-term sequelae have endured. In reviewing the expanse of literature conducted to date in this area, this paper identifies important knowledge gaps that contribute directly to this long-standing clinical dilemma. In particular, the following limitations remain. First, minimal data exist that accurately describe native {ACL} mechanics under the extreme loading rates synonymous with actual injury. Second, current {ACL} mechanical data are typically derived from isolated and oversimplified strain estimates that fail to adequately capture the true 3D mechanical response of this anatomically complex structure. Third, graft tissues commonly chosen to reconstruct the ruptured {ACL} are mechanically suboptimal, being overdesigned for stiffness compared to the native tissue. The net result is an increased risk of rerupture and a modified and potentially hazardous habitual joint contact profile. These major limitations appear to warrant explicit research attention moving forward in order to successfully maintain/restore optimal knee joint function and long-term life quality in a large number of otherwise healthy individuals.},

	abstract = {Background
Accurate knowledge about the length variation of the knee ligaments ({ACL}, {PCL}, {MCL} and {LCL}) and the popliteal complex during knee flexion/extension is essential for modelling and clinical applications. The aim of the present study is to provide this information by using an original technique able to faithfully reproduce the continuous passive knee flexion–extension kinematics and to reliably identify each ligament/tendon attachment site.
Methods
Twelve lower limbs (femur, tibia, fibula, patella) were tested and set in motion (0–120°) using an ad hoc rig. Tibio-femoral kinematics was obtained using an optoelectronic system. A 3D digital model of each bone was obtained using low-dosage stereoradiography. Knee specimens were dissected and the insertion of each ligament and popliteal complex were marked with radio opaque paint. {ACL}, {PCL} and {MCL} were separated into two bundles. Bone epiphyses were {CT}-scanned to obtain a digital model of each ligament insertion. Bones and attachment site models were registered and the end-to-end distance variation of each ligament/tendon was computed over knee flexion.
Results
A tibial internal rotation of 18° ± 4° with respect to the femur was observed. The different bundles of the {ACL}, {MCL} and {LCL} shortened, whereas all bundles of the {PCL} lengthened. The popliteal complex was found to shorten until 30° of knee flexion and then to lengthen.
Conclusion
The end-to-end distance variation of the knee ligaments and popliteal complex can be estimated during knee flexion using a robust and reliable method based on marking the ligaments/tendon insertions with radiopaque paint.

In four cadaveric knees the {ACL} was released at the tibial insertion, after which it was re-connected to a tensiometer. After pre-tensioning (10 N) the {ACL} in full-extension, the knee was flexed from 0° to 150° at 15° increments, during which the {ACL} tension was measured. At each angle the {ACL} was subsequently elongated and shortened under displacement control, while measuring the {ACL} tension. In this manner, the pre-tension or the slackness, and the mechanical response of the {ACL} were measured. All {ACL}'s displayed a higher tension at low (0°–60°) and high (120°–150°) flexion angles. The {ACL} slackness depended on flexion angle, with the highest slackness found at 75°–90°. Additionally, the {ACL} stiffness also varied with flexion angle, with the {ACL} behaving stiffer at low and high flexion angels. In general, the {ACL} was stiffest at 150°, and most compliant at 90°. The results of this study contribute to understanding the mechanical behavior of the {ACL} in-situ, and may help tuning and validating computational knee models studying {ACL} function.},

	abstract = {The biomechanics and function of the anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) have been widely studied using both experimental and simulation methods. It is known that a constitutive model of joint tissue is a critical factor in the numerical simulation. Some different ligament constitutive models have been presented to describe the {ACL} material behavior. However, the effect of the variation in the ligament constitutive model on joint kinematics and biomechanics has still not been studied. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element model of an intact tibiofemoral joint was reconstructed. Three {ACL} constitutive models were compared under different joint loads (such as anterior tibial force, varus tibial torque, and valgus tibial torque) to investigate the effect of the change of the {ACL} constitutive model. The three constitutive models corresponded to an isotropic hyperelasticity model, a transversely isotropic hyperelasticity model with neo-Hookean ground substance description, and a transversely isotropic hyperelastic model with nonlinear ground substance description. Although the material properties of these constitutive equations were fitted on the same uniaxial tension stress-strain curve, the change of the {ACL} material constitutive model was found to induce altered joint kinematics and biomechanics. The effect of different {ACL} constitutive equations on joint kinematics depended on both deformation direction and load type. The variation in the {ACL} constitutive models would influence the joint kinematic results greatly in both the anterior and internal directions under anterior tibial force as well as some other deformations such as the anterior and medial tibial translations under valgus tibial torque, and the medial tibial translation and internal rotation under varus torque. It was revealed that the transversely isotropic hyperelastic model with nonlinear ground substance description ({FE} model {III}) was the best representation of the realistic {ACL} property by a linear regression between the simulated and the experiment deformation results. But the comparison of the predicted and experiment force of ligaments showed that all the three {ACL} constitutive models represented similar force results. The stress value and distribution of {ACL} were also altered by the change in the constitutive equation. In brief, although different {ACL} constitutive models have been fitted using the same uniaxial tension curve and have the similar longitudinal material property, the {ACL} constitutive equation should still be carefully chosen to investigate joint kinematics and biomechanics due to the different transverse material behavior.},

	abstract = {Ligaments and tendons undergo volume loss when stretched along the primary fiber axis, which is evident by the large, strain-dependent Poisson׳s ratios measured during quasi-static tensile tests. Continuum constitutive models that have been used to describe ligament material behavior generally assume incompressibility, which does not reflect the volumetric material behavior seen experimentally. We developed a strain energy equation that describes large, strain dependent Poisson׳s ratios and nonlinear, transversely isotropic behavior using a novel method to numerically enforce the desired volumetric behavior. The Cauchy stress and spatial elasticity tensors for this strain energy equation were derived and implemented in the {FEBio} finite element software (www.febio.org). As part of this objective, we derived the Cauchy stress and spatial elasticity tensors for a compressible transversely isotropic material, which to our knowledge have not appeared previously in the literature. Elastic simulations demonstrated that the model predicted the nonlinear, upwardly concave uniaxial stress–strain behavior while also predicting a strain-dependent Poisson׳s ratio. Biphasic simulations of stress relaxation predicted a large outward fluid flux and substantial relaxation of the peak stress. Thus, the results of this study demonstrate that the viscoelastic behavior of ligaments and tendons can be predicted by modeling fluid movement when combined with a large Poisson׳s ratio. Further, the constitutive framework provides the means for accurate simulations of ligament volumetric material behavior without the need to resort to micromechanical or homogenization methods, thus facilitating its use in large scale, whole joint models.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the length changes of different portions (anterior, middle and posterior) of the {sMCL}, {dMCL} and {LCL} during in vivo weightbearing flexion from full extension to maximal knee flexion. Methods Using a dual fluoroscopic imaging system, eight healthy knees were imaged while performing a lunge from full extension to maximal flexion. The length changes of each portion of the collateral ligaments were measured along the flexion path of the knee. Results All anterior portions of the collateral ligaments were shown to have increasing length with flexion except that of the {sMCL}, which showed a reduction in length at high flexion. The middle portions showed minimal change in lengths except that of the {sMCL}, which showed a consistent reduction in length with flexion. All posterior portions showed reduction in lengths with flexion. Conclusions These data indicated that every portion of the ligaments may play important roles in knee stability at different knee flexion range. The soft tissue releasing during {TKA} may need to consider the function of the ligament portions along the entire flexion path including maximum flexion. Level of evidence {III}.},

	abstract = {Restricted range of motion and excessive laxity are both potential complications of total knee arthroplasty ({TKA}). During {TKA} surgery, the surgeon is frequently faced with the question of how tightly to implant the prosthesis. The most common method of altering implantation tightness is to vary the thickness of the polyethylene inlay after the bone cuts have been made and the trial components inserted. We have sought to quantify how altering the polyethylene thickness may affect post-operative soft tissue tension for a range of prosthetic designs.

Four different prosthetic designs were implanted into fresh-frozen cadaveric knee joints. All four designs were implanted in the standard manner, with a 100 Newton distraction force used to set soft tissue balance. The tibiofemoral force was then recorded at 15° intervals throughout the passive flexion range. After the standard implantation of each prosthesis, the tibial component was raised or lowered to mimic increasing and decreasing the polyethylene thickness by 2 mm and the force measurements repeated.

Tibiofemoral force in extension correlated with implantation tightness for all prosthesis designs. Between 15° and 90°of knee flexion, all four designs were insensitive to changes in implantation tightness. Beyond 90° the effect was more notable in rotating platform mobile-bearing and cruciate-retaining prostheses than in posterior-stabilised mobile-bearing designs.

The findings of this research may be useful in assisting surgical decision-making during the implantation of {TKA} prostheses.},

Also the device allows the determination of the ligament stiffness which can contribute a better understanding of the intrinsic mechanical behavior of the knee joint. Instrumentation of the device involved the use of hall-sensors for measuring the distractor displacement and strain gauges to transduce the force. The sensors were calibrated and tested to demonstrate their suitability for surgical use. Results show the distraction gap can be measured reliably with 0.1 mm accuracy and the distractive loads could be assessed with an accuracy in the range of 4 N.

	abstract = {Knowledge of ligament fibre recruitment at the human ankle joint complex is a fundamental prerequisite for analysing mobility and stability. Previous experimental and modelling studies have shown that ankle motion must be guided by fibres within the calcaneofibular and tibiocalcaneal ligaments, which remain approximately isometric during passive flexion. The purpose of this study was to identify these fibres.

Three below-knee amputated specimens were analysed during passive flexion with combined radiostereometry for bone pose estimation and 3D digitisation for ligament attachment area identification. A procedure based on singular value decomposition enabled matching bone pose with digitised data and therefore reconstructing position in space of ligament attachment areas in each joint position. Eleven ordered fibres, connecting corresponding points on origin and insertion curves, were modelled for each of the following ligaments: posterior talofibular, calcaneofibular, anterior talofibular, posterior tibiotalar, tibiocalcaneal, and anterior tibiotalar.

The measured changes in length for the ligament fibres revealed patterns of tightening and slackening. The most anterior fibre of the calcaneofibular and the medio-anterior fibre of the tibiocalcaneal ligament exhibited the most isometric behaviour, as well as the most posterior fibre of the anterior talofibular ligament. Fibres within the calcaneofibular ligament remain parallel in the transverse plane, while those within the tibiocalcaneal ligament become almost parallel in joint neutral position. For both these ligaments, fibres maintain their relative inclination in the sagittal plane throughout the passive flexion range.

The observed significant change in both shape and orientation of the ankle ligaments suggest that this knowledge is fundamental for future mechanical analysis of their response to external forces.},

	abstract = {During knee-joint motions, the fiber bundles of the knee ligaments are nonuniformly loaded in a recruitment pattern, which depends on successive relative orientations of the insertion sites. These fiber bundles vary with respect to length, orientation and mechanical properties. As a result, the stiffness characteristics of the ligaments as a whole are variable during knee-joint motion. The purpose of the present study is to characterize this variable mechanical behavior. It is hypothesized that for this purpose it is essential to consider the ligaments mechanically as multi-bundle structures in which the variability in fiber bundle characteristics is accounted for, rather than as one-dimensional structures. To verify this hypothesis, bone-ligament-bone preparations of the ligaments were subjected to series of unidirectional subfailure tensile tests in which the relative insertion orientations were varied. For each individual test specimen, this series of tensile tests was simulated with a mathematical ligament model. Geometrically, this model consists of multiple line elements, of which the insertions and orientations are anatomically based. In a mathematical optimization process, the unknown stiffness and recruitment parameters of the line elements are identified by fitting the variable stiffness characteristics of the model to those of the test series. Thus, lumped parameters are obtained which describe the mechanical behavior of the ligament as a function of the relative insertion orientation. This method of identification was applied to all four knee ligaments. In all cases, a satisfactory fit between experimental results and computer simulation was obtained, although the residual errors were lower for the cruciate ligaments (1.0–2.4\%) than for the collateral ligaments (3.7–8.1\%). It was found that models with three or less line elements were very sensitive to geometrical parameters, whereas models with more than 7 line elements suffered from mathematical redundancy. Between 4 and 7 line elements little difference was found. It is concluded that the present ligament models can realistically simulate the variable tensile behavior of human knee ligaments. Hereby the hypothesis is verified that it is essential to consider the ligaments of the knee as multi-bundle structures in order to characterize fully their mechanical behavior.},

	abstract = {In many analytic models of the knee joint, inter-insertional distance is used as the measure to define the load in a ligament. In addition, the direction of the load is taken to be the direction between the two insertions. Our in vivo data on the ovine ligament loads during gait, however, indicate that a wide range of forces is possible in the ligament for any specified inter-insertional distance. To understand the complex relationship between the bone orientations and ligament load better, an artificial neural network ({ANN}) model was developed. The six degree-of-freedom (6-{DOF}) in vivo kinematics of femur relative to tibia (joint kinematics) was used as input, and the magnitude of the anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) load was used as output/target. While the trained network was able to predict peak ligament loads with remarkable accuracy (R-square=0.98), an explicit relationship between joint kinematics and {ACL} load could not be determined. To examine the experimental and {ANN} observations further, a finite element ({FE}) model of the {ACL} was created. The geometry of the {FE} model was reconstructed from magnetic resonance images ({MRI}) of an {ACL}, and an isotropic, hyperelastic, nearly incompressible constitutive model was implemented for the {ACL}. The {FE} simulation results also indicate that a range of loads is possible in the {ACL} for a given inter-insertional distance, in concordance with the experimental/{ANN} observations. This study provides new insights for models of the knee joint; a simple force–length relationship for the ligament is not exact, nor is a single point to single point direction. More detailed microstructure-function data is required.},

These values were significantly increased at extension and flexion as the distraction force increased. Furthermore, lateral compartment stiffness was significantly lower than medial compartment stiffness. Thus, larger joint distraction forces led to larger varus ligament balance and joint center gap, because of the difference in soft tissue stiffness between lateral and medial compartments. These findings indicate the importance of the strength of joint distraction force in the assessment of soft tissue balance, especially when using gap-balancing technique.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To define the positions of the attachments of the anteromedial ({AM}) and posterolateral ({PL}) bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}). Methods: The shape and positions of the femoral and tibial attachments of the 2 bundles relative to bony landmarks were measured in 7 fresh-frozen, unpaired cadaveric knees by 6 independent observers. Metallic marker beads were then inserted into the defined anatomic points, and plain radiographs of the specimens were taken. We used the line described by Amis and Jakob on the tibia and the grid prepared by Bernard et al. for the femur to define {AM} and {PL} bundle attachment positions. Results: In the cadaveric specimens, referencing the position of the {AM} bundle tibial attachment from the retro-eminence ridge ({RER}) resulted in the least interobserver error. On tibial radiographs, the distance between the posterior tibial cortex and the perpendicular projection of the center of the {AM} bundle attachment onto Amis and Jakob’s line was 35.6 ± 5.1 mm. The ratio of this distance to the length of Amis and Jakob’s line (from the anterior cortex) was 36\% ± 3.8\% (and 52\% ± 3.4\% for the center of the {PL} bundle). On the femur, the center of the {AM} bundle was situated at 26.4\% ± 2.6\%, and the center of the {PL} bundle at 32.3\% ± 3.9\%, along the length of Blumensaat’s line. Conclusions: The {RER} provides an easily identifiable and accurate reference point that can be used clinically. On a lateral radiograph, the positions of the tibial attachments can be referenced to Amis and Jakob’s line. This method, different from Blumensaat’s line, is independent of knee flexion. Clinical Relevance: This study details anatomically and radiologically the positions of the attachments of the {AM} and {PL} bundles of the {ACL}. This could assist with accurate tunnel placement in reconstruction surgery and provide reference data for postoperative radiographic evaluation.},

These patterns are essential for understanding thoroughly the contribution of these soft tissues to joint function and of value in surgical treatments for a more conscious assessment of the knee status. Measurements from 10 normal cadaver knees are here reported using an accurate surgical navigation system and consistent anatomical references, over a large flexion arc, and according to current recommended conventions. The contours of relevant sub-bundles were digitised over the corresponding origins and insertions on the bones. Representative fibres were calculated as the straight line segments joining the centroids of these attachment areas. The most isometric fibre was also taken as that whose attachment points were at the minimum change in length over the flexion arc. Changes in length and orientation of these fibres were reported versus the flexion angle. A good general repeatability of intra- and inter-specimens was found. Isometric fibres were found in the locations reported in the literature. During knee flexion, ligament sub-bundles slacken in the anterior cruciate ligament, and in the medial and lateral collateral ligaments, whereas they tighten in the posterior cruciate ligament. In each cruciate ligament the two compounding sub-bundles have different extents for the change in fibre length, and also bend differently from each other on both tibial planes. In the collateral ligaments and patellar tendon all fibres bend posteriorly. Patellar tendon underwent complex changes in length and orientation, on both the tibial sagittal and frontal planes. For the first time thorough and consistent patterns of geometrical changes are provided for the main knee ligaments and tendons after careful fibre mapping.},

	abstract = {On the basis of earlier reported data on the in vitro kinematics of passive knee-joint motions of four knee specimens, the length changes of ligament fiber bundles were determined by using the points of insertion on the tibia and femur. The kinematic data and the insertions of the ligaments were obtained by using Roentgenstereo-photogrammetry. Different fiber bundles of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were identified. On the basis of an assumption for the maximal strain of each ligament fiber bundle during the experiments, the minimal recruitment length and the probability of recruitment were defined and determined. The motions covered the range from extension to 95 degrees flexion and the loading conditions included internal or external moments of 3 Nm and anterior or posterior forces of 30 N. The ligament length and recruitment patterns were found to be consistent for some ligament bundles and less consistent for other ligament bundles. The most posterior bundle of each ligament was recruited in extension and the lower flexion angles, whereas the anterior bundle was recruited for the higher flexion angles. External rotation generally recruited the collateral ligaments, while internal rotation recruited the cruciate ligaments. However, the anterior bundle of the posterior cruciate ligament was recruited with external rotation at the higher flexion angles. At the lower flexion angles, the anterior cruciate and the lateral collateral ligaments were recruited with an anterior force. The recruitment of the posterior cruciate ligament with a posterior force showed that neither its most anterior nor its most posterior bundle was recruited at the lower flexion angles. Hence, the posterior restraint must have been provided by the intermediate fiber bundles, which were not considered in the experiment. At the higher flexion angles, the anterior bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament and the posterior cruciate ligament were found to be recruited with anterior and posterior forces, respectively. The minimal recruitment length and the recruitment probability of ligament fiber bundles are useful parameters for the evaluation of ligament length changes in those experiments where no other method can be used to determine the zero strain lengths, ligament strains and tensions.},

	abstract = {Background
Whether anterior referencing ({AR}) or posterior referencing ({PR}) produces a more balanced flexion gap in total knee arthroplasty ({TKA}) using measured resection remains controversial. Our goal was to compare {AR} and {PR} in terms of (1) medial and lateral gaps at full extension and 90° of flexion, and (2) maximum medial and lateral collateral ligament ({MCL} and {LCL}) forces in flexion.
Methods
Computational models of 6 knees implanted with posterior-stabilized {TKA} were virtually positioned with both {AR} and {PR} techniques. The ligament properties were standardized to achieve a balanced knee at full extension. Medial-lateral gaps were measured in response to varus and valgus loading at full extension and 90° of flexion; {MCL} and {LCL} forces were estimated during passive flexion.
Results
At full extension, the maximum difference in the medial-lateral gap for both {AR} and {PR} was {\textless}1 mm in all 6 knee models. However, in flexion, only 3 {AR} and 3 {PR} models produced a difference in medial-lateral gap {\textless}2 mm. During passive flexion, the maximum {MCL} force ranged from 2 N to 87 N in {AR} and from 17 N to 127 N in {PR} models. The {LCL} was unloaded at {\textgreater}25° of flexion in all models.
Conclusion
In measured resection {TKA}, neither {AR} nor {PR} better balance the ligaments and produce symmetrical gaps in flexion. Alternative bone resection techniques and rotation alignment targets are needed to achieve more predictable knee balance.},

	abstract = {Knee ligaments guide and restrain joint motion, and their properties influence joint mechanics. Inverse modeling schemes have been used to estimate specimen-specific ligament properties, where external joint forces are assumed to balance with internal ligament and contact forces. This study simplifies this assumption by adjusting experimental loads to remove internal contact forces. The purpose of this study was to use novel experimental loading in an inverse modeling scheme to estimate ligament slack lengths, perform validation using additional loading scenarios, and evaluate sensitivity to the applied loading. Joint kinematics and kinetics were experimentally measured for a set of load cases. An optimization scheme used a specimen-specific forward kinematics model to estimate ligament slack lengths by minimizing the residual between model and experimentally measured kinetics. The calibrated model was used for a form of validation by evaluating non-optimized load cases. Additionally, uncertainty analysis related kinetic errors to previously reported kinematic errors. The six {DOF} tibial reactions realized {RMS} errors less than 23 N and 0.75 Nm for optimized load cases, and 33 N and 2.25 Nm for the non-optimized load cases. The uncertainty analysis, which was performed using the optimized load cases, showed average kinetic {RMS} errors less than 26 N and 0.45 Nm. The model’s recruitment patterns were similar to those found in clinical and cadaveric studies. This study demonstrated that experimental distraction loading can be used in an inverse modeling scheme to estimate ligament slack lengths with a forward kinematics model.},

On the theoretical side, we develop closed-form expressions for the tangent moduli which appear not to have been previously recorded in full generality in the literature. Quasi-incompressible response is accounted for by means of a three-field variational principle which makes use of a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into volume preserving and dilatational parts. The incompressible limit is enforced by means of a simple and effective augmented Lagrangian procedure. Two possible implementations are discussed. Numerical examples are presented that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation.},

In this contribution we sketch and compare two methods to introduce a physically meaningful stress/strain state to the obtained geometry for simulations in the finite strain regime and demonstrate the necessity of such prestressing techniques. One method is based on an inverse design analysis to calculate a stress-free reference configuration. The other method developed here is based on a modified updated Lagrangian formulation.

	abstract = {Patient-specific biomechanical modeling of the cardiovascular system is complicated by the presence of a physiological pressure load given that the imaged tissue is in a pre-stressed and -strained state. Neglect of this prestressed state into solid tissue mechanics models leads to erroneous metrics (e.g. wall deformation, peak stress, wall shear stress) which in their turn are used for device design choices, risk assessment (e.g. procedure, rupture) and surgery planning. It is thus of utmost importance to incorporate this deformed and loaded tissue state into the computational models, which implies solving an inverse problem (calculating an undeformed geometry given the load and the deformed geometry). Methodologies to solve this inverse problem can be categorized into iterative and direct methodologies, both having their inherent advantages and disadvantages. Direct methodologies are typically based on the inverse elastostatics ({IE}) approach and offer a computationally efficient single shot methodology to compute the in vivo stress state. However, cumbersome and problem-specific derivations of the formulations and non-trivial access to the finite element analysis ({FEA}) code, especially for commercial products, refrain a broad implementation of these methodologies. For that reason, we developed a novel, modular {IE} approach and implemented this methodology in a commercial {FEA} solver with minor user subroutine interventions. The accuracy of this methodology was demonstrated in an arterial tube and porcine biventricular myocardium model. The computational power and efficiency of the methodology was shown by computing the in vivo stress and strain state, and the corresponding unloaded geometry, for two models containing multiple interacting incompressible, anisotropic (fiber-embedded) and hyperelastic material behaviors: a patient-specific abdominal aortic aneurysm and a full 4-chamber heart model.},

	abstract = {{IntroductionLoads} acting on the knee are tied to the long term performance of implants, and are directly related to ligament function [1]. Previous work has used computational models coupled with optimization to estimate ligament properties based on experimental joint kinematics [2]. Our group recently utilized a similar optimization scheme that estimated ligament slack lengths based on experimental implant contact metrics [3]. A comparison with surgically relevant loading conditions that were excluded from the optimization would help establish the utility of the simulation framework. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess the predictive capability of two simulated knees using comparisons with experimentally determined trends found after systematic removal of key tissues. Similar techniques may support clinical joint balancing techniques, as well as identify factors that dictate long term implant performance.{MethodsKnee} arthroplasty was performed by orthopedic surgeons for four cadaveric specimens. Instrumented trial inserts ({VERASENSE}, {OrthoSensor}, Inc., Dania Beach, {FL}) were used and experimentation utilized the {simVITROTM} robotic musculoskeletal simulator (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, {OH}) to measure tibiofemoral kinematics under interoperative style loading. Three successive laxity style tests were performed at 10° flexion: anterior-posterior force (±100 N), varus-valgus moment (±5 Nm), and internal-external moment (±3 Nm). Kinematics and implant forces were measured throughout testing. Specimens were first tested in the intact state, then the laxity tests were repeated after systematic release of the posterior cruciate ligament ({PCL}), superficial medial collateral ligament ({sMCL}), or popliteus ({POP}). Significant changes in kinematics and contact metrics were determined using regression analysis between the intact versus the tissue released states.Finite element models were developed for two specimens, and optimized ligament slack lengths were found using methods described previously [3] (Fig. 1). The experimental laxity style loads were applied to both optimized models with intact ligaments, and with individually released {PCL}, {sMCL}, or {POP} ligaments. Knee kinematics and tibial contact loads were predicted, and trended responses from the intact simulations to those with released ligaments were determined (i.e. higher, lower or no change). Simulation results were then compared with the statistically significant findings from the experimental tests.Results and {DiscussionBoth} models generally recreated the significant experimental trends. Specimen 3 recreated 8 of the 9 directional changes, while specimen 4 realized 7 of the 9 (Table 1). Release of the {POP} in specimen 4 contradicted both specimen 3 and the experimental results. This may highlight specimen-specific behavior, or a misrepresentation of the tissue restraint on the posterolateral corner. Ongoing testing and simulation will evaluate areas of discrepancy, with particular focus on specimen specific mechanics.This work shows that simulation can estimate significant trends in physical testing. The framework demonstrates promise for development of a tool to understand the consequences of intra-operative tissue balancing. Future work will investigate representation of the posterolateral corner, and evaluate the predictive capacity for the absolute specimen-specific changes in joint mechanics due to tissue release.{AcknowledgementsOrthosensor} Inc.For any figures or tables, please contact authors directly (see Info \& Metrics tab above).},

	abstract = {Purpose
To determine the effect of debriding the indirect insertion component of the femoral anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) attachment on tibiofemoral kinematics when compared with the intact knee.
Methods
Knee kinematics were measured in 9 cadaveric knees with the {ACL} intact, after indirect insertion debridement, and after {ACL} transection. Three loading conditions were used: (1) a 134-N anterior tibial load, (2) a combined 10-Nm valgus and 5-Nm internal tibial torque, and (3) a simulated robotic pivot shift. Anterior tibial translation ({ATT}) was recorded in response to anterior and combined loads at 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90° of flexion. Posterior tibial translation and external tibial rotation were recorded during the simulated pivot shift.
Results
With an anterior load, indirect insertion debridement increased {ATT} by 0.37 ± 0.24 mm at 0° (P = .002) and by 0.16 ± 0.19 mm at 15° (P = .033; increases {\textless}1 mm in all specimens). {ACL} transection increased {ATT} in response to an anterior load (P = .0001) with maximum effect at 15° compared with the intact and debrided states (11.26 ± 1.15 mm and 11.04 ± 1.08 mm, respectively). With a combined load, indirect insertion debridement increased {ATT} by 0.17 ± 0.11 mm at 0° (P = .001; increases {\textless}0.3 mm in all specimens) with no effect at other angles. {ACL} transection increased {ATT} in response to a combined load (P = .001) with maximum effect at 15° (4.45 ± 0.85 mm v {ACL} intact and 4.44 ± 0.84 mm v debrided indirect insertion). In the {ACL} intact condition, the pivot shift produced 1.29 ± 1.34 mm of posterior tibial translation and 1.54 ± 1.61° of external tibial rotation, as compared with 1.28 ± 1.34 mm and 1.54 ± 1.47°, respectively, after debridement (P = .68 and P = .99, respectively) and 12.79 ± 3.22 mm and 17.60 ± 4.30°, respectively, after {ACL} transection (P = .0001).
Conclusions
The indirect femoral {ACL} insertion contributes minimally to restraint of tibial translation and rotation.
Clinical Relevance
Femoral tunnel positioning for anatomic {ACL} reconstruction should aim to recreate the biomechanically significant direct insertion.},

	abstract = {Understanding of tibiofemoral joint mechanics at multiple spatial scales is essential for developing effective preventive measures and treatments for both pathology and injury management. Currently, there is a distinct lack of specimen-specific biomechanical data at multiple spatial scales, e.g., joint, tissue, and cell scales. Comprehensive multiscale data may improve the understanding of the relationship between biomechanical and anatomical markers across various scales. Furthermore, specimen-specific multiscale data for the tibiofemoral joint may assist development and validation of specimen-specific computational models that may be useful for more thorough analyses of the biomechanical behavior of the joint. This study describes an aggregation of procedures for acquisition of multiscale anatomical and biomechanical data for the tibiofemoral joint. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to acquire anatomical morphology at the joint scale. A robotic testing system was used to quantify joint level biomechanical response under various loading scenarios. Tissue level material properties were obtained from the same specimen for the femoral and tibial articular cartilage, medial and lateral menisci, anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, and medial and lateral collateral ligaments. Histology data were also obtained for all tissue types to measure specimen-specific cell scale information, e.g., cellular distribution. This study is the first of its kind to establish a comprehensive multiscale data set for a musculoskeletal joint and the presented data collection approach can be used as a general template to guide acquisition of specimen-specific comprehensive multiscale data for musculoskeletal joints.},

	abstract = {Background
Recent anatomic and clinical studies have shown that the location of the injury to the elbow ulnar collateral ligament ({UCL}) is an important variable in deciding on surgical intervention; however, no studies have evaluated these findings biomechanically.
Methods
This study tested 16 intact elbow specimens. Valgus torques of 2.5 and 5 Nm were applied to the elbow at various flexion angles, and the resulting valgus angles were measured. The valgus angles were applied to the elbows in their intact states and again after partial and complete cuts were made on the proximal and distal insertions of the {UCL}. Resulting valgus torques were measured, and stiffness was calculated for each elbow flexion angle. Unpaired t tests were used to evaluate the effects of cut location and flexion angle on joint rotational stability and stiffness.
Results
The posterior-distal insertion contributed the most to stability. At valgus angles generated from 2.5 Nm intact torques, the posterior-distal insertions contributed to 51\% ± 26\% (P {\textless} .03) intact rotational stability, and at valgus angles generated from 5 Nm intact torques, the posterior-distal insertions contributed to 41\% ± 17\% (P {\textless} .02) intact rotational stability. For overall stiffness, the posterior-distal insertions contributed to 31\% ± 12\% (P {\textless} .045) intact stiffness.
Conclusion
Overall, the posterior distal insertion of the {UCL} contributed most to rotational stability and stiffness of the medial elbow when subjected to valgus stress at 90° and 120° of elbow flexion. At higher elbow flexion angles, the posterior insertions contributed more to stability, whereas the anterior insertions had a greater effect at lower flexion angles.},

	abstract = {Recent clinical evidence has suggested that tasks performed in kneeling or squatting postures place the knee at a higher risk for injury because loads across the knee might overload the ligaments. The objective of this study was to develop a subject-specific model of the knee that is kinematically driven to predict the forces in the major ligaments at high flexion angles. The geometry of the femur, tibia, and fibula and the load-elongation curves representing the structural properties of the {ACL}, {PCL}, {LCL}, and {MCL} served as inputs to the model, which represented each ligament as a nonlinear elastic spring. To drive the model, kinematic data was obtained while loads were applied to the same cadaveric knee at four flexion angles. The force in each ligament during the recorded kinematic data allowed an optimization procedure to determine the location of the ligament attachment sites on each bone and their reference lengths. The optimization procedure could successfully minimize the differences between the experimental and predicted forces only when the kinematics at 90°, 120°, and 140° of flexion were utilized. This finding suggests that the ligaments at the knee function differently at high-flexion angles compared to low flexion angles and separate models must be used to examine each range of motion. In the future, the novel experimental and computational methodology will be used to construct additional models and additional knee kinematics will be input to help elucidate mechanisms of injury during tasks performed in kneeling or squatting postures.},

In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network ({QIN}) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside., 3D Slicer is a free open source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm, and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions., In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of {QIN}, we discuss several use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing {QIN} teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer.},

	abstract = {Inferior anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) structural properties may inadequately restrain tibiofemoral joint motion following surgery, contributing to the increased risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Using both a direct measure of {ACL} linear stiffness and an in vivo magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) T2*-based prediction model, we hypothesized that cartilage damage and {ACL} stiffness would increase over time, and that an inverse relationship between cartilage damage and {ACL} stiffness would emerge at a later stage of healing. After either 6, 12, or 24 weeks (w) of healing after {ACL} repair, {ACL} linear stiffness was determined from the force–displacement relationship during tensile testing ex vivo and predicted in vivo from the {MRI} T2*-based multiple linear regression model in 24 Yucatan minipigs. Tibiofemoral cartilage was graded postmortem. There was no relationship between cartilage damage and {ACL} stiffness at 6 w (R2 = 0.04; p = 0.65), 12 w (R2 = 0.02; p = 0.77), or when the data from all animals were pooled (R2 = 0.02; p = 0.47). A significant inverse relationship between cartilage damage and {ACL} stiffness based on both ex vivo measurement (R2 = 0.90; p {\textless} 0.001) and in vivo {MRI} prediction (R2 = 0.78; p = 0.004) of {ACL} stiffness emerged at 24 w. This result suggests that 90\% of the variability in gross cartilage changes is associated with the repaired {ACL} linear stiffness at 6 months of healing. Clinical Significance: Techniques that provide a higher stiffness to the repaired {ACL} may be required to mitigate the post-traumatic osteoarthritis commonly seen after {ACL} injury, and {MRI} T2* can be used as a noninvasive estimation of ligament stiffness. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

	abstract = {Characterization of the main tibiofemoral ligaments is an essential step in developing patient-specific computational models of the knee joint for personalized surgery pre-planning. Tensile tests are commonly performed in-vitro to characterize the mechanical stiffness and rupture force of the knee ligaments which makes the technique unsuitable for in-vivo application. The time required for the limited noninvasive approaches for properties estimation based on knee laxity remained the main obstacle in clinical implementation. Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) technique can be a platform to noninvasively assess the knee ligaments. In this study the aim was to explore the potential role of quantitative {MRI} and dimensional properties, in characterizing the mechanical properties of the main tibiofemoral ligaments. After {MR} scanning of six cadaveric legs, all 24 main tibiofemoral bone-ligaments-bone specimens were tested in vitro. During the tensile test cross sectional area of the specimens was captured using ultrasound and force-displacement curve was extracted. Digital image correlation technique was implemented to check the strain behavior of the specimen and rupture region and to assure the fixation of ligament bony block during the test. The volume of the specimen was measured using manual segmentation data, and quantitative {MR} parameters as T2*, T1ρ, and T2 were calculated. Linear mixed statistical models for repeated measures were used to examine the association of {MRI} parameters and dimensional measurements with the mechanical properties (stiffness and rupture force). The results shows that while the mechanical properties were mostly correlated to the volume, inclusion of the {MR} parameters increased the correlation strength for stiffness (R2 ≈ 0.48) and partial rupture force (R2 = 0.53). Inclusion of ligament type in the statistical analysis enhanced the correlation of mechanical properties with {MR} parameters and volume as for stiffness (R2 = 0.60) and partial rupture (R2 = 0.57). In conclusion, this study revealed the potentials in using quantitative {MR} parameters, T1ρ, T2 and T2*, combined with specimen volume to estimate the essential mechanical properties of all main tibiofemoral ligaments required for subject-specific computational modeling of human knee joint.},

A lack of consensus on the evidentiary bar for model validation has hindered broader acceptance, particularly in regulatory areas. This has motivated the {US} Food and Drug Administration and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ({ASME}), in partnership with medical device companies and software providers, to develop a structured approach for establishing the credibility of computational models for a specific use. Charged with this mission, the {ASME} V\&V 40 Subcommittee on Verification and Validation (V\&V) in Computational Modeling of Medical Devices developed a risk-informed credibility assessment framework; the main tenet of the framework is that the credibility requirements of a computational model should be commensurate with the risk associated with model use. This article provides an overview of the {ASME} V\&V 40 standard and an example of the framework applied to a generic centrifugal blood pump, emphasizing how experimental evidence from in vitro testing can support computational modeling for device evaluation. Two different contexts of use for the same model are presented, which illustrate how model risk impacts the requirements on the V\&V activities and outcomes.},

	abstract = {Inferior anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) structural properties may inadequately restrain tibiofemoral joint motion following surgery, contributing to the increased risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Using both a direct measure of {ACL} linear stiffness and an in vivo magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) T2*-based prediction model, we hypothesized that cartilage damage and {ACL} stiffness would increase over time, and that an inverse relationship between cartilage damage and {ACL} stiffness would emerge at a later stage of healing. After either 6, 12, or 24 weeks (w) of healing after {ACL} repair, {ACL} linear stiffness was determined from the force–displacement relationship during tensile testing ex vivo and predicted in vivo from the {MRI} T2*-based multiple linear regression model in 24 Yucatan minipigs. Tibiofemoral cartilage was graded postmortem. There was no relationship between cartilage damage and {ACL} stiffness at 6 w (R2 = 0.04; p = 0.65), 12 w (R2 = 0.02; p = 0.77), or when the data from all animals were pooled (R2 = 0.02; p = 0.47). A significant inverse relationship between cartilage damage and {ACL} stiffness based on both ex vivo measurement (R2 = 0.90; p {\textless} 0.001) and in vivo {MRI} prediction (R2 = 0.78; p = 0.004) of {ACL} stiffness emerged at 24 w. This result suggests that 90\% of the variability in gross cartilage changes is associated with the repaired {ACL} linear stiffness at 6 months of healing. Clinical Significance: Techniques that provide a higher stiffness to the repaired {ACL} may be required to mitigate the post-traumatic osteoarthritis commonly seen after {ACL} injury, and {MRI} T2* can be used as a noninvasive estimation of ligament stiffness. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

	doi = {10.1177/2325967114547346},
	abstract = {Background:
Most knee joint biomechanics studies have involved knees with an isolated anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) injury. However, a large portion of patients with injured {ACLs} have accompanied meniscus tearing. In this study, the in vivo alteration of knee biomechanics after tearing the {ACL} with or without combined medial or lateral meniscus tear was investigated during stair-ascending activity.

Hypothesis:
The kinematic behavior of {ACL}-deficient knees changes with a combined medial or lateral meniscus tear.

Study Design:
Controlled laboratory study.

Methods:
Twenty-one patients with injured {ACLs} (contralateral side intact) were recruited before undergoing {ACL} reconstruction. Among these patients, 5 had isolated {ACL} injuries (group I), 8 had combined {ACL} and medial meniscus injuries (group {II}), and 8 had combined {ACL} and lateral meniscus injuries (group {III}). Bilateral magnetic resonance scans were obtained on each patient to construct 3-dimensional anatomic knee models. Both knees were then scanned during stair-climbing activity using a dual fluoroscopic imaging system. The knee kinematics during stair climbing were reproduced using a bone model image matching method. Anteroposterior and mediolateral translations and axial tibial rotation of the knee during stair ascent were then compared between the injured and intact contralateral knees of the patients.

Results:
On average, injured knees in groups I and {III} showed more than 2 mm increased anterior tibial translation close to full knee extension. In group {II}, no statistically significant difference was observed between the injured and contralateral side in anteroposterior translation. Near full extension, in groups I and {III}, injured knees had less than 1 mm of increased medial tibial translation compared with the contralateral side, whereas in group {II}, a 1.0-mm increase in lateral tibial shift was observed in the injured knees. With regard to axial tibial rotation, group I showed an increased external tibial rotation (approximately 5°), group {II} had little variation, whereas group {III} had increased internal tibial rotation (approximately 3°).

Conclusion:
The results of this study demonstrate that a combined {ACL}/meniscus injury could alter the kinematics of {ACL}-injured knees in a different way compared with knees with isolated {ACL} tears, depending on the pattern of the meniscus tear. Considering the varying effect of meniscus injuries on knee joint kinematics, future studies might focus on specific treatment of patients with combined {ACL} and meniscus injuries to protect the joint from abnormal kinematics and subsequent postoperative cartilage degeneration.},

Discovering the anterior cruciate ligament injury risk factors associated with the tibial plateau may lead to delineation of the existing sex-based disparity in anterior cruciate ligament injuries and help develop strategies for the prevention of anterior cruciate ligament injuries regardless of gender.{HypothesisIndividuals} with a shallower medial tibial depth of concavity, while having increased posteriorly directed slope of their tibial plateau, are at increased risk of suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury compared with those with decreased posterior slope and increased medial tibial depth. Furthermore, these relationships are different between men and women.Study {DesignCase}-control study (prevalence); Level of evidence, 3.{MethodsThe} medial, lateral, and coronal tibial plateau slopes as well as the medial tibial depth of concavity in 55 uninjured controls (33 women and 22 men) and 49 anterior cruciate ligament?injured cases (27 women and 22 men) were measured using magnetic resonance images. First, a preliminary t test was performed to establish any existing differences between groups. Next, a logistic regression model was developed to determine the probability of anterior cruciate ligament injury in an individual based on the measured covariates.{ResultsThe} female anterior cruciate ligament?injured cases had increased lateral tibial slope (P = .03) and shallower medial tibial depth (P = .0003) compared with the uninjured controls, while male cases had increased lateral and medial tibial slope (P = .02) and shallower medial tibial depth (P = .0004) compared with controls. The logistic regression analysis and odds ratio estimates showed that medial tibial depth is an important risk factor (odds ratio = 3.03 per 1 mm decrease in its value), followed by lateral tibial slope (odds ratio = 1.17 per 1° increase in its value) in all participants. The medial tibial slope (odds ratio = 1.18 per 1° increase in its value) was a risk factor only in men.{ConclusionA} combination of increased posterior-directed tibial plateau slope and shallow medial tibial plateau depth could be a major risk factor in anterior cruciate ligament injury susceptibility regardless of gender. Different injury risk models may be needed for men and women as other key risk factors are identified.},

	abstract = {Background:Multivariate analysis that identifies the combination of risk factors associated with anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) trauma is important because it provides insight into whether a variable has a direct causal effect on risk or an indirect effect that is mediated by other variables. It can also reveal risk factors that might not be evident in univariate analyses; if a variable?s effect is moderated by other variables, its association with risk may be apparent only after adjustment for the other variables. Most important, multivariate analyses can identify combinations of risk factors that are more predictive of risk than individual risk factors.Hypothesis:A diverse combination of risk factors predispose athletes to first-time noncontact {ACL} injury, and these relationships are different for male and female athletes.Study Design:Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods:Athletes competing in organized sports at the high school and college levels participated in this study. Data from injured subjects (109 suffering an {ACL} injury) and matched controls (227 subjects) from the same athletic team were analyzed with multivariate conditional logistic regression to examine the effects of combinations of variables (demographic characteristics, joint laxity, lower extremity alignment, strength, and personality traits) on the risk of suffering their first {ACL} injury and to construct risk models.Results:For male athletes, increases in anterior-posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur (knee laxity), posterior knee stiffness, navicular drop, and a decrease in standing quadriceps angle were jointly predictive of suffering an {ACL} injury. For female athletes the combined effects of having a parent who had suffered an {ACL} injury and increases in anterior-posterior knee laxity and body mass index were predictive of {ACL} injury.Conclusion:Multivariate models provided more information about {ACL} injury risk than individual risk factors. Both male and female risk models included increased anterior-posterior knee laxity as a predictor of {ACL} injury but were otherwise dissimilar.},

Motivated by the observation that the aforementioned formula is not 3uitable for a spatial description, a dual picture of elasticity is derived according to which the metric at the reference configuration is playing a central role. Hereby the free energy is considered to be a direct function of the Almansi strain tensor (or alternatively the inverse left Cauchy-Green tensor) leading to relations well suited for a spatial description. A new stress tensor to be regarded as the dual variable of the Almansi strain tensor is defined. Its geometric interpretation leads further to the statement that the rotated (isometric) Cauchy stress tensor can be derived by varying the free energy function with respect to the metric of the reference configuration. Moreover, by considering the isometric tensors of the aforementioned strain tensors we arrive at the conclusion that the Cauchy stress tensor can be derived by varying the free energy function with respect to the inverse of the metric at the actual configuration. These statements can be considered as the counterpart of the Doyle-Ericksen formula in a spatial description.},

Discrete element analysis ({DEA}) is a computationally efficient method to estimate cartilage contact stresses with potential application at the {PFJ} to better understand {PFJ} mechanics. The current study validated a {DEA} modeling framework driven by {PFJ} kinematics to predict experimentally-measured {PFJ} contact stress distributions. Two cadaveric knee specimens underwent quadriceps muscle [215 N] and joint compression [350 N] forces at ten discrete knee positions representing {PFJ} positions during early gait while measured {PFJ} kinematics were used to drive specimen-specific {DEA} models. {DEA}-computed contact stress and area were compared to experimentally-measured data. There was good agreement between computed and measured mean and peak stress across the specimens and positions (r = 0.63–0.85). {DEA}-computed mean stress was within an average of 12\% (range: 1–47\%) of the experimentally-measured mean stress while {DEA}-computed peak stress was within an average of 22\% (range: 1–40\%). Stress magnitudes were within the ranges measured (0.17–1.26 {MPa} computationally vs 0.12–1.13 {MPa} experimentally). {DEA}-computed areas overestimated measured areas (average error = 60\%; range: 4–117\%) with magnitudes ranging from 139 to 307 mm2 computationally vs 74–194 mm2 experimentally. {DEA} estimates of the ratio of lateral to medial patellofemoral stress distribution predicted the experimental data well (mean error = 15\%) with minimal measurement bias. These results indicate that kinematically-driven {DEA} models can provide good estimates of relative changes in {PFJ} contact stress.},

The aim of this study was to provide a clear anatomical interpretation of these structures. We dissected 40 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees to view the relevant anatomy and identified a consistent structure in 33 knees (83\%); we termed this the anterolateral ligament of the knee. This structure passes antero-distally from an attachment proximal and posterior to the lateral femoral epicondyle to the margin of the lateral tibial plateau, approximately midway between Gerdy’s tubercle and the head of the fibula. The ligament is superficial to the lateral (fibular) collateral ligament proximally, from which it is distinct, and separate from the capsule of the knee. In the eight knees in which it was measured, we observed that the ligament was isometric from 0° to 60° of flexion of the knee, then slackened when the knee flexed further to 90° and was lengthened by imposing tibial internal rotation.

The mean popliteus tendon and popliteofibular ligament load response at 0° was significantly less than the mean load response at 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion.{ConclusionsHigh} relative loads were seen on the fibular collateral ligament with varus and external rotation and on the popliteus tendon and popliteofibular ligament, with external rotation. A reciprocal relationship of load sharing in external rotation depending on knee flexion angle was revealed that has not been previously reported. The force on the fibular collateral ligament with external rotation loads was higher than the load on the popliteus complex at lower flexion angles, with the popliteus complex having higher load sharing at 60° and 90° of knee flexion. These results provide a measure of the potential for failure of these structures with joint loading and guidelines for both graft strength requirements for surgical reconstructions and postoperative rehabilitation protocols.},

	abstract = {The finite element ({FE}) method has been widely used to investigate knee biomechanics. Time integration algorithms for dynamic problems in finite element analysis can be classified as either implicit or explicit. Although previously both static/dynamic implicit and dynamic explicit method have been used, a comparative study on the outcomes of both methods is of high interest for the knee modeling community. The aim of this study is to compare static, dynamic implicit and dynamic explicit solutions in analyses of the knee joint to assess the prediction of dynamic effects, potential convergence problems, the accuracy and stability of the calculations, the difference in computational time, and the influence of mass-scaling in the explicit formulation. The heel-strike phase of fast, normal and slow gait was simulated for two different body masses in a model of the native knee. Our results indicate that ignoring the dynamic effect can alter joint motion. Explicit analyses are suitable to simulate dynamic loading of the knee joint in high-speed simulations, as this method offers a substantial reduction of the computational time with a similar prediction of cartilage stresses and meniscus strains. Although mass-scaling can provide even more gain in computational time, it is not recommended for high-speed activities, in which inertial forces play a significant role.},

	abstract = {The primary aim of this study was to assess the effects of total knee arthroplasty ({TKA}) implant design on collateral ligament elongation patterns that occur during level walking, downhill walking, and stair descent. Using a moving fluoroscope, tibiofemoral kinematics were captured in three groups of patients with different {TKA} implant designs, including posterior stabilized, medial stabilized, and ultra-congruent. The 3D in vivo joint kinematics were then fed into multibody models of the replaced knees and elongation patterns of virtual bundles connecting origin and insertion points of the medial and lateral collateral ligaments ({MCL} and {LCL}) were determined throughout complete cycles of all activities. Regardless of the implant design and activity type, non-isometric behavior of the collateral ligaments was observed. The {LCL} shortened with increasing knee flexion, while the {MCL} elongation demonstrated regional variability, ranging from lengthening of the anterior bundle to slackening of the posterior bundle. The implant component design did not demonstrate statistically significant effects on the collateral elongation patterns and this was consistent between the studied activities. This study revealed that post-{TKA} collateral ligament elongation is primarily determined by the knee flexion angle. The different anterior translation and internal rotation that were induced by three distinctive implant designs had minimal impact on the length change patterns of the collateral ligaments.},

	abstract = {Background:The individual kinematic roles of the anterolateral ligament ({ALL}) and the distal iliotibial band Kaplan fibers in the setting of anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) deficiency require further clarification. This will improve understanding of their potential contribution to residual anterolateral rotational laxity after {ACL} reconstruction and may influence selection of an anterolateral extra-articular reconstruction technique, which is currently a matter of debate.Hypothesis/Purpose:To compare the role of the {ALL} and the Kaplan fibers in stabilizing the knee against tibial internal rotation, anterior tibial translation, and the pivot shift in {ACL}-deficient knees. We hypothesized that the Kaplan fibers would provide greater tibial internal rotation restraint than the {ALL} in {ACL}-deficient knees and that both structures would provide restraint against internal rotation during a simulated pivot-shift test.Study Design:Controlled laboratory study.Methods:Ten paired fresh-frozen cadaveric knees (n = 20) were used to investigate the effect of sectioning the {ALL} and the Kaplan fibers in {ACL}-deficient knees with a 6 degrees of freedom robotic testing system. After {ACL} sectioning, sectioning was randomly performed for the {ALL} and the Kaplan fibers. An established robotic testing protocol was utilized to assess knee kinematics when the specimens were subjected to a 5-N·m internal rotation torque (0°-90° at 15° increments), a simulated pivot shift with 10-N·m valgus and 5-N·m internal rotation torque (15° and 30°), and an 88-N anterior tibial load (30° and 90°).Results:Sectioning of the {ACL} led to significantly increased tibial internal rotation (from 0° to 90°) and anterior tibial translation (30° and 90°) as compared with the intact state. Significantly increased internal rotation occurred with further sectioning of the {ALL} (15°-90°) and Kaplan fibers (15°, 60°-90°). At higher flexion angles (60°-90°), sectioning the Kaplan fibers led to significantly greater internal rotation when compared with {ALL} sectioning. On simulated pivot-shift testing, {ALL} sectioning led to significantly increased internal rotation and anterior translation at 15° and 30°; sectioning of the Kaplan fibers led to significantly increased tibial internal rotation at 15° and 30° and anterior translation at 15°. No significant difference was found when anterior tibial translation was compared between the {ACL}/{ALL}- and {ACL}/Kaplan fiber?deficient states on simulated pivot-shift testing or isolated anterior tibial load.Conclusion:The {ALL} and Kaplan fibers restrain internal rotation in the {ACL}-deficient knee. Sectioning the Kaplan fibers led to greater tibial internal rotation at higher flexion angles (60°-90°) as compared with {ALL} sectioning. Additionally, the {ALL} and Kaplan fibers contribute to restraint of the pivot shift and anterior tibial translation in the {ACL}-deficient knee.Clinical Relevance:This study reports that the {ALL} and distal iliotibial band Kaplan fibers restrain anterior tibial translation, internal rotation, and pivot shift in the {ACL}-deficient knee. Furthermore, sectioning the Kaplan fibers led to significantly greater tibial internal rotation when compared with {ALL} sectioning at high flexion angles. These results demonstrate increased rotational knee laxity with combined {ACL} and anterolateral extra-articular knee injuries and may allow surgeons to optimize the care of patients with this injury pattern.},

	abstract = {Residual anterolateral rotatory laxity following injury and reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) has become a popular topic and has generated interest in characterizing the relative contribution from the anterolateral structures of the knee. Studies have reported on the anatomic and biomechanical features of the anterolateral ligament ({ALL}), revealing a role in restraining internal tibial rotation in both {ACL}-intact and {ACL}-deficient knees. The Kaplan fibers of the iliotibial band have also been reported to provide significant restraint to internal tibial rotation. The {ACL} is the primary restraint to anterior tibial translation, and both the proximal and distal bundles of the iliotibial band, with a divergent orientation, also provide significant static restraint against internal tibial rotation, and each bundle may have a distinct individual role. In the setting of {ACL} deficiency, subsequent sectioning of the {ALL} and Kaplan fibers led to further increases in anterior tibial translation. Residual rotatory laxity that may be seen clinically following {ACL} reconstruction may be attributable to an associated anterolateral structure injury even in the setting of an anatomic {ACLR}, leading to consideration for a concomitant anterolateral structure reconstruction. Studies evaluating the kinematic influence of anatomic {ALL} reconstruction or lateral extra-articular tenodesis have focused on internal rotation, axial plane translation, and anterior tibial translation, with variable results having been reported. Further, despite the long history of anterolateral structure reconstruction, most commonly with a lateral extra-articular tenodesis, the clinical use of these combined techniques is still in its relative infancy, and long-term patient outcomes have yet to be published for relative comparisons.},

	abstract = {The deformation gradient admits a multiplicative decomposition into a purely volumetric component and a purely distortional component. For a hyperelastic material, based on this decomposition, the elastic strain energy potential, the stress, and the elasticity tensor can be expressed in general as a function of both the volumetric deformation and the distortional deformation. However, the volumetric—distortional decomposition of deformation has often been employed in a fully decoupled form of the elastic strain energy potential, which is expressed as the sum of a term depending solely on the volumetric deformation and a term depending solely on the distortional deformation. This work has three main objectives. First, to derive the elasticity tensor in the general (non-decoupled) case, in its material, spatial, and linear forms; this is achieved by extensive use of fourth-order tensor algebra, and in particular of the properties of the so-called spherical operator, which is largely used, but very seldom given the dignity of being assigned a symbol and a name, in the literature. Second, to show that a fully decoupled potential gives rise to an elasticity tensor which may be inconsistent with its linearized counterpart, as some components of the linear elasticity tensor in general do not have a corresponding term in nonlinear decoupled elasticity tensor. Third, to obtain the conditions under which a purely hydrostatic stress causes a purely volumetric deformation, by means of the developed theory; the results show that this condition is satisfied if and only if the elastic potential is fully decoupled. While the whole approach is completely independent of the material symmetry, the cases of isotropy and transverse isotropy are shown as an example.},

	abstract = {Constitutive relations are fundamental to the solution of problems in continuum mechanics, and are required in the study of, for example, mechanically dominated clinical interventions involving soft biological tissues. Structural continuum constitutive models of arterial layers integrate information about the tissue morphology and therefore allow investigation of the interrelation between structure and function in response to mechanical loading. Collagen fibres are key ingredients in the structure of arteries. In the media (the middle layer of the artery wall) they are arranged in two helically distributed families with a small pitch and very little dispersion in their orientation (i.e. they are aligned quite close to the circumferential direction). By contrast, in the adventitial and intimal layers, the orientation of the collagen fibres is dispersed, as shown by polarized light microscopy of stained arterial tissue. As a result, continuum models that do not account for the dispersion are not able to capture accurately the stress–strain response of these layers. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to develop a structural continuum framework that is able to represent the dispersion of the collagen fibre orientation. This then allows the development of a new hyperelastic free-energy function that is particularly suited for representing the anisotropic elastic properties of adventitial and intimal layers of arterial walls, and is a generalization of the fibre-reinforced structural model introduced by Holzapfel \& Gasser (Holzapfel \& Gasser 2001 Comput. Meth. Appl. Mech. Eng. 190, 4379–4403) and Holzapfel et al. (Holzapfel et al. 2000 J. Elast. 61, 1–48). The model incorporates an additional scalar structure parameter that characterizes the dispersed collagen orientation. An efficient finite element implementation of the model is then presented and numerical examples show that the dispersion of the orientation of collagen fibres in the adventitia of human iliac arteries has a significant effect on their mechanical response.},

	abstract = {This work is aimed at emphasising the relationship between metric and deformation, under the light of a novel formalism for the Polar Decomposition Theorem. All results are first presented in the classical formalism of Cauchy’s celebrated theorem, and then in the proposed alternative formalism. Although the latter requires a little more work to be established, it allows for directly defining all strain tensors as “covariant”, i.e. with both feet being covectors. Emphasis is also placed on how, in the absence of the metric structure, the available mathematical tools are restricted to the deformation gradient alone. Along with these main results, and in the didactical intention that permeates this work, several hints are given, which could be useful in teaching Continuum Mechanics, e.g. the rigorous definition of the determinant of the deformation gradient in Riemannian manifolds, and a caveat on the definition of the spatial Hencky logarithmic strain. The setting is that of modern Continuum Mechanics, based on the description given by Differential Geometry in terms of differentiable manifolds. However, passing to the simpler case of affine spaces takes almost no effort, paying attention to keeping the distinction between vectors and covectors, and therefore allowing the matrices representing the metric tensors to differ from the unit matrix.},

These forms are intimately related to the pulled-back and pushed-forward metric tensors, and are somewhat awkward to derive in Cartesian coordinates, because of the loss of the distinction between a vector space and its dual, and therefore between objects having contravariant and covariant components, which obey to different transformation laws. The relationship between the deformation and the various forms of the identity, spherical, and deviatoric operators can be entirely clarified only within a covariant theory, where the central role played by the spatial and material metric tensors, and their pulled-back and pushed-forward counterparts, which are deformation tensors, can be emphasised.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To describe the insertions of the superficial medial collateral ligament ({sMCL}) and posterior oblique ligament ({POL}) and their related osseous landmarks. Methods: Insertions of the {sMCL} and {POL} were identified and marked in 22 unpaired human cadaveric knees. The surface area, location, positional relations, and morphology of the {sMCL} and {POL} insertions and related osseous structures were analyzed on 3-dimensional images. Results: The femoral insertion of the {POL} was located 18.3 mm distal to the apex of the adductor tubercle ({AT}). The femoral insertion of the {sMCL} was located 21.1 mm distal to the {AT} and 9.2 mm anterior to the {POL}. The angle between the femoral axis and femoral insertion of the {sMCL} was 18.6 degrees, and that between the femoral axis and the {POL} insertion was 5.1 degrees. The anterior portions of the distal fibers of the {POL} were attached to the fascia cruris and semimembranosus tendon, whereas the posterior fibers were attached to the posteromedial side of the tibia directly. The tibial insertion of the {POL} was located just proximal and medial to the superior edge of the semimembranosus groove. The tibial insertion of the {sMCL} was attached firmly and widely to the tibial crest. The mean linear distances between the tibial insertion of the {POL} or {sMCL} and joint line were 5.8 and 49.6 mm, respectively. Conclusions: This study used 3-dimensional images to assess the insertions of the {sMCL} and {POL} and their related osseous landmarks. The {AT} was identified clearly as an osseous landmark of the femoral insertions of the {sMCL} and {POL}. The tibial crest and semimembranosus groove served as osseous landmarks of the tibial insertions of the {sMCL} and {POL}. Clinical Relevance: By showing further details of the anatomy of the knee, the described findings can assist surgeons in anatomic reconstruction of the {sMCL} and {POL}.},

Additional cutting of the posterior oblique ligament increased posterior tibial translation significantly at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of flexion under posterior tibial load and at all flexion angles tested under valgus or internal tibial load (P {\textless} .05). Additional cutting of the posteromedial capsule increased posterior tibial translation only at 0° and 30° in response to a valgus and internal tibial load (P {\textless} .05).{ConclusionThe} posterior oblique ligament and posteromedial capsule have a significant role in the prevention of additional posterior tibial translation in the knee with posterior cruciate ligament injury.Clinical {RelevanceThe} posterior oblique ligament should be addressed in the patient with combined injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament and the posteromedial structures.},

	abstract = {The cells in the midsubstance portion of skeletal ligaments typically have elongated shapes, but where ligaments insert into bone the cells appear very rounded and the tissue phenotype is that of fibrocartilage. Between the midsubstance and the insertions there is a gradient in cell shape and tissue phenotype that has been hypothesized to reflect a gradient of mechanical stresses. To test this hypothesis, cell shapes (an index of tissue phenotype) were quantified in the central part of the femoral insertion of the rabbit medial collateral ligament by computer-assisted histomorphometry. Morphometric measurements were correlated with the mechanical stresses and strains in the central part of the insertion as predicted by finite element analysis. Throughout the ligament the direction of the predicted principal tensile stresses coincides with the direction of the collagen fibers which curve from the midsubstance to meet the femur at nearly right angles. Principal compressive stresses also occur within the ligament: the highest are localized near the bone; the lowest in the midsubstance. The areas with the roundest cells correspond to the areas with the highest principal compressive stresses in the model; the areas with the flattest cells correspond to the areas with the lowest compressive stresses in the model. A correlation between cell shape and mechanical stresses suggests that physiological loading of the {MCL} is important for the maintenance of tissue phenotype throughout this insertion. We theorize that the cells in ligament insertions adapt to the prevailing local mechanical environment.},

	abstract = {Concurrent multiscale simulation strategies are required in computational biomechanics to study the interdependence between body scales. However, detailed finite element models rarely include muscle recruitment due to the computational burden of both the finite element method and the optimization strategies widely used to estimate muscle forces. The aim of this study was twofold: first, to develop a computationally efficient muscle force prediction strategy based on proportional-integral-derivative ({PID}) controllers to track gait and chair rise experimental joint motion with a finite element musculoskeletal model of the lower limb, including a deformable knee representation with 12 degrees of freedom; and, second, to demonstrate that the inclusion of joint-level deformability affects muscle force estimation by using two different knee models and comparing muscle forces between the two solutions. The {PID} control strategy tracked experimental hip, knee, and ankle flexion/extension with root mean square errors below 1°, and estimated muscle, contact and ligament forces in good agreement with previous results and electromyography signals. Differences up to 11\% and 20\% in the vasti and biceps femoris forces, respectively, were observed between the two knee models, which might be attributed to a combination of differing joint contact geometry, ligament behavior, joint kinematics, and muscle moment arms. The tracking strategy developed in this study addressed the inevitable tradeoff between computational cost and model detail in musculoskeletal simulations and can be used with finite element musculoskeletal models to efficiently estimate the interdependence between muscle forces and tissue deformation.},

Finally, in three of the limbs the {ACL} was surgically reconstructed and then imaged with and without tension applied to the tension graft.

T1ρ imaging can be performed in the forms of T1ρ-weighted image, T1ρ mapping and T1ρ dispersion. T1ρ imaging, particularly at low spin-lock frequency, is sensitive to B0 and B1 inhomogeneity. Various composite spin-lock pulses have been proposed to alleviate the influence of field inhomogeneity so as to reduce the banding-like spin-lock artifacts. T1ρ imaging could be specific absorption rate ({SAR}) intensive and time consuming. Efforts to address these issues and speed-up data acquisition are being explored to facilitate wider clinical applications. This paper reviews the T1ρ imaging’s basic physic principles, as well as its application for cartilage imaging and intervertebral disc imaging. Compared to more established T2 relaxation time, it has been shown that T1ρ provides more sensitive detection of proteoglycan ({PG}) loss at early stages of cartilage degeneration.

Relaxation times were compared between time points with {ANOVA} tests. Log-transformed autograft and allograft relaxation times were compared with the Student t tests. The relationship between {KOOS} and relaxation times at 24 months was investigated with Spearman's rank correlation. {ACL} graft T1ρ relaxation times were significantly higher at 6 months relative to 12 months (P = .042), 24 months (P {\textless} .001), and 36 months (P {\textless} .001). {ACL} graft T2 relaxation times were significantly higher at 6 months relative to 12 months (P = .036), 24 months (P {\textless} .001), and 36 months (P {\textless} .001).

Bi-cruciate retaining ({BCR}) {TKA} design allows retention of both {ACL} and {PCL}. However, there is a limited data on the {ACL}/{PCL} in-vivo elongation characteristics of {BCR} {TKA}. The study aimed to evaluate and compare the in-vivo elongation patterns of {ACL}/{PCL} between {BCR} {TKA} and contralateral non-implanted knee and to explore potential factors leading to the changed elongation patterns between limbs. {ACL}/{PCL} elongations of both knees during sit-to-stand were measured in 29 unilateral {BCR} {TKA} patients using a validated dual fluoroscopic tracking technique. Joint gap changes of the {BCR} {TKA} knees relative to the contralateral knee were quantified. {BCR} {TKA} and the contralateral non-implanted knee exhibited similar {ACL} elongation at extension and clinical anterior knee laxity. However, {BCR} {TKA} showed significantly greater {PCL} elongation during flexion than the non-implanted knee. Variation of changed elongation was observed for both {ACL} and {PCL}, suggesting a heterogeneous restoration of normal {ACL}/{PCL} functions. A significant correlation was found between extension joint gap change and the change of {ACL} elongation, highlighting the importance of precise joint line restoration and soft tissue balancing during {BCR} {TKA} surgery. Our findings suggest that {BCR} {TKA} did not fully restore “near-normal” cruciate ligament elongation patterns and anteroposterior stability. Considerable heterogeneity remains in the retained ligament elongation patterns and warrants further investigations of multifactorial factors to optimize {ACL}/{PCL} functions in {BCR} {TKA}. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

	abstract = {Purpose:To detect early osteoarthritis ({OA}) in a canine Pond?Nuki model 3 weeks after anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) transection surgery, both topographically over the medial tibial surface and depth-dependently over the cartilage thickness.Methods:Four topographical locations on each {OA} and contralateral medial tibia were imaged individually by magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) at 17.6 µm transverse resolution. The quantitative {MRI} T2 relaxation data were correlated with the biomechanical stress-relaxation measurements from adjacent locations.Results:{OA} cartilage was thinner than the contralateral tissue and had a lower modulus compared to the contralateral cartilage for the exterior, interior, and central medial tibia locations. Depth-dependent and topographical variations were detected in {OA} cartilage by a number of parameters (compressive modulus, glycosaminoglycan concentration, bulk and zonal thicknesses, T2 at 0° and 55° specimen orientations in the magnet). T2 demonstrated significant differences at varying depths between {OA} and contralateral cartilage.Conclusion:{ACL} transection caused a number of changes in the tibial cartilage at 3 weeks after the surgery. The characteristics of these changes, which are topographic and depth-dependent, likely reflect the complex degradation in this canine model of {OA} at the early developmental stage.},

	abstract = {The aim of anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) reconstruction is to restore normal function of the knee, but unfortunately abnormal kinematics and a predisposition to knee osteoarthritis occur in a significant percentage of patients. So there is an ongoing need to improve treatment options and long-term outcome of patients with a ruptured {ACL}. With the recent advancements in the field of {ACL} tissue engineering, the focus of treatment for {ACL} injuries is changing from resection and reconstruction toward repair and regeneration. Several new {ACL} repair methods were recently introduced as an alternative to traditional {ACL} reconstructive procedures. Radiologists must become familiar with these new surgical methods to interpret their appearance correctly on postoperative imaging studies. This article provides an overview of the latest advancements in {ACL} surgical methods and discusses the role of imaging to assess the postoperative {ACL} including both standard and advanced imaging methods.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) could potentially be used to non-invasively predict the strength of an {ACL} graft after {ACL} reconstruction. We hypothesized that the volume and T2 relaxation parameters of the {ACL} graft measured with {MRI} will predict the graft structural properties and anteroposterior ({AP}) laxity of the reconstructed knee. Nine goats underwent {ACL} reconstruction using a patellar tendon autograft augmented with a collagen or collagen–platelet composite. After 6 weeks of healing, the animals were euthanized, and the reconstructed knees were retrieved and imaged on a 3T scanner. {AP} laxity was measured prior to dissecting out the femur–graft–tibia constructs which were then tested to tensile failure to determine the structural properties. Regression analysis indicated a statistically significant relationship between the graft volume and the failure load (r2=0.502; p=0.049). When graft volume was normalized to the T2 relaxation time, the relationship was even greater (r2=0.687; p=0.011). There was a significant correlation between the graft volume and the linear stiffness (r2=0.847; p{\textless}0.001), which remained significant with T2 normalization (r2=0.764; p=0.002). For {AP} laxity at 30° flexion, there was not a significant correlation with graft volume, but there was a significant correlation with volume normalized by the T2 relaxation time (r2=0.512; p=0.046). These results suggest that {MRI} volumetric measures combined with graft T2 properties may be useful in predicting the structural properties of {ACL} grafts.},

	abstract = {Background: Although T1rho and T2 map magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) have been perceived as useful diagnostic modalities for cartilage degeneration, no studies have assessed whether these two sequences are useful for monitoring {ACL} graft maturation after {ACL} reconstruction. The present study examined whether the two sequences reflect graft function and maturation after {ACL} reconstruction.
Methods: Twenty consecutive patients who consented to undergo {MRI} at 3, 6, and 12 months after double-bundle {ACL} reconstruction were enrolled. {MRI} was performed using T1 rho and T2 map sequences in a single session. Temporal changes in T1rho and T2 values of a purely tendinous portion of graft were assessed at each time point. Correlations were analyzed between T1rho or T2 map values and clinical results, including anteroposterior laxity at 2 and 4 years postoperatively, pivot shift test results at 4 years, and graft tension on second-look arthroscopy. Separate analyses were performed for the anteromedial bundle ({AMB}) and posterolateral bundle ({PLB}).
Results: T1rho sequence was able to visualize the tendinous portions of {AMB} and {PLB} more clearly than T2 map sequence even on gray-scale images. Mean T1rho and T2 map values gradually decreased during the first operative year, but the trend was more prominent and consistent for T1rho values than for T2 map values. Correlation analysis revealed that T1rho and T2 map values at 1 year correlated significantly with anteroposterior laxity at 2 and 4 years. This trend was found in both {AMB} and {PLB}. Both T1rho and T2 map values failed to exhibit a statistical correlation with arthroscopic findings of graft tension.
Conclusions: The present study was the first trial to assess the feasibility of T1rho and T2 map sequences to objectively monitor the course of graft maturation after {ACL} reconstruction. Both sequences successfully detected purely tendinous portions of graft, and mean values gradually decreased during the first year postoperatively. Both values at 1 year correlated significantly with anteroposterior laxity of the knee joint at 4 years, indicating that the values reflected graft fate.},
